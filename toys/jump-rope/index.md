A jump rope is a length of cord with handles at each end, used for a skipping game that dates back centuries. Dutch settlers brought rope-jumping to North America in the 1600s, where it evolved into a playground activity with regional variations. The jump rope was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2000.

## What It Is

A jump rope consists of a flexible cord, typically 6 to 9 feet long for individual use, with a handle attached at each end. Children's jump ropes come in several forms: cloth ropes braided from cotton or nylon, solid PVC or vinyl cords, and beaded ropes featuring plastic segments strung over a nylon core. Beaded ropes produce an audible click when striking the ground, which helps beginners establish rhythm. The correct length for an individual allows the child to stand on the rope's center with both ends reaching approximately armpit height. Longer ropes, sometimes 12 to 16 feet, are used for group games where two turners swing the rope while others jump.

## How Kids Play

Children jump rope alone or in groups. A solo jumper holds one handle in each hand and swings the rope overhead and under their feet in a continuous arc, jumping as the rope passes beneath them. In group play, two children hold opposite ends of a longer rope and turn it in a steady rhythm while one or more jumpers enter the arc, jump repeatedly, and exit without stopping the rope.

Many jumping sessions follow traditional rhymes and chants that set the pace and add game structure. Counting rhymes challenge jumpers to track how many times they clear the rope. Action rhymes direct the jumper to touch the ground, spin around, or perform other movements mid-jump. In "Double Dutch," two ropes turn simultaneously in opposite directions, requiring precise timing to jump between them. Chinese jump rope uses a circular elastic band held at ankle height between two standing players, with the jumper performing a sequence of foot movements over and around the band.

Children often play in small groups on sidewalks, playgrounds, or driveways, taking turns as jumpers and rope turners.

## Notes

Coordination required for successful jumping typically develops around age 5, though younger children practice stepping over stationary ropes or swinging ropes without jumping. Double Dutch became particularly associated with urban neighborhoods in the northeastern United States during the mid-20th century. Rhymes and chants vary by region and have been passed down and modified across generations. The activity shifts naturally between cooperative group play and individual skill practice within the same session.

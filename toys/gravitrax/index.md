GraviTrax is a modular marble run construction system made by Ravensburger, first released in 2017. The system uses gravity, magnetism, and kinetic energy to move steel marbles through user-designed tracks. All pieces across the CORE, PRO, and POWER product lines are compatible with each other.

## What It Is

GraviTrax consists of several component types that connect together on a hexagonal grid system. Cardboard baseplates with punched hexagonal holes form the foundation. Plastic height tiles stack to create elevation changes. Track tiles (curves, junctions, intersections) rest on the height tiles and guide marble movement. Plastic rail pieces of varying lengths connect track tiles to each other.

The standard Starter Set contains approximately 124 pieces: 4 baseplates, 52 height tiles (40 large, 12 small), 34 track tiles, 18 rail pieces in three lengths, and 6 steel marbles in silver, red, blue, and green. Special elements called "action stones" add mechanical functions like the Magnetic Cannon, Trampoline, and Spiral. The PRO line introduced vertical building with pillars and walls. The POWER line added battery-operated electronic elements.

White track tiles are made from polystyrene. Action bricks with snap-hook mechanisms use ABS plastic, which has a slightly more yellow-cream tone than the polystyrene pieces.

## How Kids Play

Children typically start by following the included instruction booklets, which provide step-by-step track designs. After completing guided builds, many move to free-form construction, experimenting with track layouts and element placement.

Play often involves trial and error. A marble may stop partway through a track, prompting adjustment of height tile stacking or track angles. Children test whether marbles have enough momentum to complete loops or trigger action stones. Multiple marbles can run simultaneously, creating timing challenges at junctions.

Building sessions range from quick 15-minute constructions to multi-hour projects. Some children disassemble and rebuild frequently; others maintain tracks for days. Collaborative building with siblings or parents is common, with participants dividing tasks like height tile stacking and track placement.

## Notes

The system requires a flat surface with adequate space. Completed tracks can span several feet. Pieces do not lock permanently, so tracks can shift if bumped.

Young children under 8 may find independent construction challenging due to the precision required for piece alignment and the physics calculations needed for successful marble runs. Adult assistance during initial builds is commonly reported by parents.

The hexagonal grid system means tracks naturally form angles rather than straight lines. This geometric constraint influences design possibilities.

Marbles are small steel spheres. The system includes a finishing element that catches marbles at track end points.

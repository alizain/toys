Barbie is a fashion doll manufactured by Mattel, first introduced in 1959. Standing approximately 11 inches (29 cm) tall with the proportions of an adult woman, Barbie was the first mass-produced toy doll in the United States to feature adult characteristics rather than infant or child features.

## What It Is

A Barbie doll consists of a rigid plastic torso with movable limbs. The head is made of hard vinyl with rooted synthetic hair that can be brushed and styled. The arms are made from flexible ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), while the legs and torso use harder plastics including ABS and polypropylene for articulated joints. Modern dolls feature multiple points of articulation at the shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, though simpler versions have fewer joints.

Each doll comes with removable clothing and often includes accessories such as shoes, handbags, jewelry, or hair accessories. The clothing features closures like velcro or snaps sized for small fingers. Barbie's full character name is Barbara Millicent Roberts, and over the decades the line has expanded to include Ken (boyfriend, introduced 1961), Skipper (sister, 1964), Midge (friend, 1963), and numerous other named characters.

The product line extends beyond individual dolls to include playsets and environments. The Dreamhouse, a multi-story dollhouse first introduced in 1962, is perhaps the most recognized accessory. Current versions stand over 40 inches tall and include multiple rooms, working elevators, slides, pools, and extensive furniture and accessory pieces.

Barbie dolls are available in various body types (original, tall, petite, curvy), skin tones, hair colors and textures, eye colors, and with different occupational themes. Career-themed dolls come with profession-specific accessories like stethoscopes, briefcases, or astronaut helmets.

## How Kids Play

Children primarily engage in imaginative role-play and storytelling with Barbie dolls. A typical play session involves dressing and undressing the dolls, positioning them in scenes, acting out dialogue, and moving them through narrative scenarios. The dolls serve as avatars through which children explore social situations, relationships, and adult roles.

Younger children (ages 3-5) often focus on dressing the dolls, arranging accessories, and simpler scenario play. Older children develop more complex storylines with multiple characters, dialogue, and extended narratives that may continue across multiple play sessions. Play is frequently solo but also adapts well to social play with friends or siblings, where children negotiate storylines and share characters.

The extensive accessory ecosystem encourages extended play. Children move dolls through domestic spaces (kitchens, bedrooms, living rooms), outdoor settings (pools, cars, campers), and occupational environments (offices, veterinary clinics, recording studios). Brushing and styling hair is a distinct play activity, separate from scenario play.

Play sessions tend to run long, often 45 minutes to two hours, as children construct and elaborate narratives. Children frequently mix Barbie with other dolls, action figures, or toys, incorporating them into storylines.

## Notes

The doll's body proportions have been a subject of discussion for decades. The original 1959 design featured exaggerated proportions that would be anatomically impossible in a real person. Mattel has introduced more varied body types since 2016, though the original silhouette remains in production.

Older Barbie dolls (particularly those manufactured before 2007) used plasticizers that are no longer considered safe for children's toys. Vintage dolls should be treated as collectibles rather than play items for young children.

The clothing and small accessories present organizational challenges. Shoes, in particular, are easily lost. Many families use dedicated storage solutions like tackle boxes or compartmentalized containers for accessories.

Hair quality varies significantly across product lines. Premium dolls feature hair that withstands more brushing and styling, while budget lines may tangle or deteriorate more quickly with handling.

The Barbie ecosystem creates ongoing purchasing opportunities. The dolls themselves are relatively affordable, but the playsets, vehicles, houses, and themed accessory packs represent substantial additional investments. Children often develop strong preferences for specific themed collections.

Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel, created Barbie after observing her daughter Barbara playing with paper dolls and imagining adult scenarios. The doll was designed to let children project themselves into adult roles rather than practicing nurturing behavior typical of baby dolls. The doll debuted at the American International Toy Fair on March 9, 1959.

Schleich Dinosaurs is a collection of hand-painted dinosaur figurines produced by the German toy company Schleich. The line includes individual dinosaur figures, themed playsets, and accessories featuring prehistoric creatures. Schleich has been manufacturing collectible figurines since 1935, with dinosaurs being one of their established product categories.

## What It Is

Each Schleich dinosaur figure is a solid PVC plastic sculpture depicting a specific prehistoric species. The figures are hand-painted with attention to anatomical details such as skin texture, teeth, claws, and coloring. Sizes vary by species: a Tyrannosaurus rex figure weighs approximately 0.65 pounds, while larger specimens like the Giganotosaurus weigh around 1.1 pounds.

The collection includes carnivores (Tyrannosaurus rex, Giganotosaurus, Velociraptor, Allosaurus), herbivores (Triceratops, Brachiosaurus, Bajadasaurus), and marine reptiles (Mosasaurus). Some species are available in multiple color variants. Playsets incorporate environments like volcano bases, research stations, and temple ruins, often including vehicles and human figures alongside the dinosaurs.

## How Kids Play

Children use the figures for imaginative scenario play, creating hunting scenes, battles between species, or research expeditions. The solid construction allows for physical play including being carried around, staged in dioramas, or used outdoors in sand or dirt.

Figures are often collected over time, with children accumulating multiple species. They may be organized by type (predators vs. prey), size, or historical period. Some children incorporate the dinosaurs into play with other toy lines, vehicles, or building blocks.

The playsets provide structured narrative frameworks (escaping from dinosaurs, capturing specimens, exploring ruins) while individual figures support open-ended play.

## Notes

Product descriptions on the Schleich website include educational facts about each species, such as diet, size, and habitat. The Tyrannosaurus rex product page notes details like tooth length and binocular vision, framing the figures within a paleontological context.

The figures do not have articulated joints or moving parts. Jaws are typically in fixed poses.

Schleich updates their dinosaur line periodically, retiring older molds and introducing new species or color variants. Some figures become limited edition or collector items.

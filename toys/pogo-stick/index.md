The pogo stick is a spring-loaded jumping device that has been a children's toy since the early twentieth century. The modern design, featuring two handles and a metal frame, was developed by George Hansburg in 1957. Children use it to bounce repeatedly in place or while moving forward.

## What It Is

A pogo stick consists of a vertical pole with a T-shaped handlebar at the top and two footpads extending from the sides near the bottom. A coil spring connects the upper and lower sections of the pole, housed either inside the frame or enclosed within a protective casing. The bottom of the pole terminates in a rubber tip that contacts the ground. Most models intended for children stand roughly waist-height when at rest and weigh between two and five pounds. The frame is typically constructed from steel or aluminum tubing, with foam padding wrapped around sections where hands and body may contact the pole during use.

## How Kids Play

Children stand on the footpads while gripping both handles, then push downward with their legs to compress the spring. As the spring releases, it propels both the rider and stick upward. Riders learn to time their leg movements to maintain a continuous bouncing rhythm. Beginning users often hold onto a wall, fence, or adult's hand while developing balance. Once comfortable, children bounce in place, counting jumps or attempting to maintain bouncing for extended periods. More experienced users move across flat surfaces while bouncing and may attempt turns or small hops over objects. Play typically occurs on driveways, sidewalks, or other hard, flat surfaces. Some children compete informally to achieve the highest number of consecutive bounces.

## Notes

The name "pogo" likely derives from the surnames of German inventors Max Pohlig and Ernst Gottschall, who patented an early version in 1920. Weight matters more than age for determining appropriate use; children under approximately 40-50 pounds may lack sufficient mass to compress standard springs effectively. Foam pogo jumpers, which use a squeezable foam base rather than a mechanical spring, exist as an alternative for younger or lighter children. The enclosed spring design found on many contemporary models reduces the risk of fingers or clothing becoming caught in the mechanism. Pogo sticks share functional similarities with stilts in that both require developing a sense of dynamic balance rather than static standing.

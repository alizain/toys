Sorry! is a board game based on the ancient Indian cross-and-circle game Pachisi, similar to Ludo. Originally patented in England in 1929 by William Henry Storey of Southend-on-Sea, the game was later acquired by Parker Brothers in 1934 and is now manufactured by Hasbro.

## What It Is

The game consists of a folding cardboard game board featuring a square track with colored start areas and home spaces in each corner. The set includes 16 translucent plastic pawns in four colors (four per player), a deck of 45 cards, and an instruction sheet. The cards are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12, with Sorry! cards replacing sixes and nines (which are omitted to prevent confusion). The board has colored slide sections along each side and a safety zone of five spaces leading to each player's home area.

## How Kids Play

Players draw cards from a central deck and move their pawns around the board according to the card instructions. A player must draw a 1, 2, or Sorry! card to move a pawn out of the start area onto the track. Players attempt to move all four of their pawns around the board and into their home space before opponents do the same. Landing on an opponent's pawn sends that pawn back to its start area. Landing on the beginning of a slide (except one's own color) causes the pawn to slide to the end, bumping any pawns in the way back to their respective starts. Players often send each other backward or back to start, which gives the game its name.

## Notes

The game accommodates 2 to 4 players. The title refers to the social dynamic where players apologize (often insincerely) when bumping opponents' pawns back to start. The 7 card can be split between two pawns, and the 4 card requires moving backward. The Sorry! card allows a player to take a pawn from start and swap it with an opponent's pawn, sending that pawn back to its start. Pawns in the safety zone cannot be bumped or swapped. Younger children may find the frequent setbacks frustrating, as progress can be undone repeatedly by opponents' moves.

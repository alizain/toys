# Session Summary

**Session ID**: dfee6ff5-bd88-43f1-b275-3be8680a4f29

**Date/Timestamp**: December 25, 2025, starting at 16:23:35 UTC (Christmas Day)

**Main Topic**: Building a "Toys" website to display and rate children's toys from an external data source

## What was tried

The session focused on creating a new Next.js package called "toys" within an existing monorepo. The approach involved:

1. **Exploration Phase**: Examined the existing monorepo structure, identified Next.js projects (sensei, cuttlefish-web), and explored the external toys database at `~/Experiments/toys/`

2. **Data Structure Discovery**: Found that the toys database consists of:
   - `ratings.csv` with columns: filename, toy_name, repeatability, session_length, cleanup_ease, total
   - Individual markdown files for each toy with YAML frontmatter (name, link) and content

3. **Package Creation**: Copied structure from the `sensei` Next.js package, creating:
   - `package.json` with gray-matter dependency for parsing markdown frontmatter
   - `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`
   - Custom CSS with Tailwind v4 and oklch color definitions

4. **Data Loading Implementation**: Created `lib/toys.ts` to:
   - Read toys from `~/Experiments/toys/toys/` directory
   - Parse CSV ratings file
   - Merge markdown content with ratings
   - Sort by total score (highest first)

5. **UI Development**: Built React components:
   - `RatingBar` - Visual progress bar for individual ratings
   - `ToyCard` - Card component displaying toy info, ratings, and score badge
   - Main page with hero section, stats, rating legend, and responsive grid

## What was found/learned

- The toys database uses a simple but effective structure: markdown files for content/descriptions and a separate CSV for numerical ratings
- Rating categories are: repeatability, session_length, cleanup_ease (each 1-5 scale, max total 15)
- 32 toys were in the database at the time, with scores ranging from 6 (Minecraft Magnet Tiles) to 15 (Strider Balance Bike, YOTO Player)
- Top-rated toys (14-15) include: Wooden Blocks, Sarah's Silks, Dress-Up Clothes, Grimm's Rainbow Stacker, Play Kitchen, Crayola Crayons, Weighted Blanket, Aqua Doodle Mat

## What was accomplished

- Created a fully functional Next.js website package at `packages/toys/`
- Implemented dynamic data loading from external directory (so other agents can add toys)
- Built a polished UI with:
  - Purple/violet gradient hero section
  - Stats showing total toys, excellent picks, and average repeatability
  - Color-coded score system (emerald for 14-15, amber for 12-13, rose for lower)
  - Responsive 3-column grid layout
  - Rating bars with color-coded progress indicators
- Successfully built and ran dev server on port 3003

## Key files created

- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/package.json`
- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/lib/toys.ts` - Data loading logic
- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/components/toy-card.tsx`
- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/components/rating-bar.tsx`
- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/app/page.tsx` - Main page
- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/app/layout.tsx`
- `/Users/alizain/803/web/packages/toys/app/globals.css`

## Key design decisions

- Used `force-dynamic` and `revalidate = 0` to ensure fresh data on each request (since other agents may be adding toys)
- Rating thresholds: Excellent (14-15), Great (12-13), Good (10-11), Okay (below 10)
- Fonts: Space Grotesk for headings, Nunito for body text
- Color scheme uses oklch colors for a modern purple/violet theme

## Open questions

- No filtering or sorting UI was implemented (only default sort by total score)
- Individual toy detail pages were not created
- No search functionality
- Images for toys are not supported (only text/ratings currently)

Finger paint is a thick, non-toxic paint formulated for direct application with hands and fingers rather than brushes. Developed by American educator Ruth Faison Shaw in the 1920s and patented in 1931, finger paint was designed to allow children to create art through direct tactile contact with the medium. Shaw described finger paints as "direct descendants of mud pies" to which she had "added the rainbow."

## What It Is

Finger paint is a water-based paint with a smooth, thick consistency that spreads easily under pressure from fingers and hands. The formulation typically includes binding agents such as liquid starch, flour, or cornstarch mixed with non-toxic pigments. Commercial versions often contain additional ingredients like sodium alginate or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose to achieve the proper texture and prevent spoilage. The paint has a cool, squishy texture when wet and dries to a matte finish that does not crack or flake.

Finger paint is sold in squeeze bottles or jars, typically in sets of primary and secondary colors. The paint washes easily from skin and most clothing. It is commonly used on glossy finger paint paper, which has a coated surface that resists over-saturation and allows the paint to glide smoothly. Children can also paint on trays, plastic surfaces, or other washable materials.

Notable brands include Crayola, which produces washable finger paints in various package sizes and formats, including mess-free painting stations where paint is contained beneath a flexible plastic cover.

## How Kids Play

Children apply finger paint directly to paper or other surfaces using their fingers, palms, fists, and forearms. They spread the paint in sweeping motions, drag fingers through it to create lines and patterns, and press their hands flat to make prints. The activity involves whole-arm movements rather than the fine motor control required for brush painting.

Young children often begin by exploring the sensory qualities of the paint, squishing it between their fingers and spreading it across the surface without concern for creating representational images. They experiment with mixing colors together on the paper, watching blue and yellow combine into green or red and blue into purple. Older children may use fingers to draw shapes, figures, or patterns in the paint, sometimes scraping away paint to reveal the paper beneath.

The painting process is typically fluid and exploratory. Children add more paint, layer colors, and rework areas repeatedly. The absence of a brush removes a barrier between the child and the medium, making the activity feel more immediate and physical than traditional painting.

## Notes

Finger painting occupies an unusual position among art materials because the tactile experience is central to the activity rather than incidental to it. The paint exists specifically to be touched and manipulated directly, making it as much a sensory play material as an art supply.

The mess-free variations that have emerged, where paint is sealed inside plastic bags or beneath flexible covers, preserve some visual aspects of the activity while eliminating the tactile element that defines traditional finger painting. These adaptations serve practical purposes but represent a fundamentally different experience.

Shaw's original therapeutic applications of finger painting recognized that the freedom of the medium, the lack of right or wrong technique, and the direct physical engagement provided psychological benefits beyond artistic expression. The activity continues to be used in educational and therapeutic settings for these reasons.

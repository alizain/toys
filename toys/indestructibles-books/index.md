Indestructibles are a line of baby books designed to withstand chewing, crumpling, and drooling. Created by Amy Pixton, a mother of triplets, after she observed bits of traditional board books ending up in her babies' mouths. The books are published by Workman Publishing.

## What It Is

Indestructibles are 7-inch square books printed on Tyvek, a synthetic material made from flashspun high-density polyethylene fibers. The material feels similar to paper but cannot be torn, punctured, or damaged by water. Each book contains approximately 12 pages and weighs very little, making them thin like a paperback rather than bulky like a board book. The pages feature bright, high-contrast illustrations with minimal or no text. The line includes titles covering nursery rhymes, animals, colors, shapes, counting, and daily routines, with some editions available in bilingual English/Spanish formats.

## How Kids Play

Babies interact with these books the way they interact with most objects: mouthing, gumming, crumpling, and pulling. Infants under six months tend to listen while a caregiver reads and watch pages being turned. Around four to six months, babies begin tactile exploration, grabbing and chewing the pages. By nine months, many babies start turning pages themselves. Toddlers point at and name pictures. The books can be thrown, stepped on, dragged across floors, and taken into the bath. When soiled, they go in the washing machine or dishwasher.

## Notes

The books conform to ASTM F963 toy safety standards and CPSIA guidelines. They are free of BPA, phthalates, PVC, and lead. The lack of text on most pages means these function more as picture-prompt books for caregiver-child conversation than as traditional read-aloud stories. The physical durability means these often survive multiple children in a household. The thinness of the pages differs noticeably from board books, which some babies seem to prefer for the crinkly texture and flexibility.

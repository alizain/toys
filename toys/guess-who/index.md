Guess Who? is a two-player deduction game created by Ora and Theo Coster in 1979. Originally released in the Netherlands under the title "Wie is het?", the game was later published by Milton Bradley and subsequently by Hasbro. Players attempt to identify their opponent's hidden character by asking yes-or-no questions about physical features.

## What It Is

The game consists of two identical plastic frames that face each other, allowing players to sit opposite one another. Each frame holds a grid of 24 character faces displayed on a double-sided sheet that slides into place. Small hinged doors or flip-down panels cover each face, allowing players to eliminate characters by pushing them down or closing them. A separate deck of 24 mystery cards corresponds to the characters on the board. Each player draws one mystery card and places it in a slot on their frame, hidden from their opponent. Scoring pegs are included for tracking wins across multiple games.

## How Kids Play

At the start of each game, both players select a mystery card without showing it to their opponent. Players take turns asking single yes-or-no questions about their opponent's character, such as "Does your person wear glasses?" or "Does your person have brown hair?" Based on the answer, the asking player flips down any faces that no longer match the possible mystery character. Play continues back and forth until one player believes they have identified the opponent's character and makes a guess. An incorrect guess results in immediate loss, so players typically narrow down options before guessing. The game often proceeds quickly, with rounds lasting a few minutes.

## Notes

The character roster has changed across different editions since 1979, with art styles ranging from cartoonish to more realistic depending on the version. Some editions include themed character sets such as pets or superheroes. The game requires adult assembly when first opened. The tabletop-style boards have been the standard format, though handheld travel versions have also been produced. The game is commonly used to introduce young children to logical reasoning and the process of elimination.

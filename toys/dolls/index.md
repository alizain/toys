Dolls are figures representing humans, typically depicting babies, children, or adults, designed for children to hold, carry, and incorporate into imaginative play. They range from simple soft cloth figures to detailed plastic or vinyl replicas with articulated limbs and realistic features. Dolls are among the oldest known toys, with archaeological evidence of doll-like figures dating back thousands of years across many cultures.

## What It Is

Dolls are three-dimensional figures made from various materials depending on the type and intended age group. Modern dolls commonly use vinyl (polyvinyl chloride) for the head and limbs, which allows for detailed molding of facial features and can be painted to create realistic appearances. Many dolls feature a combination of materials: vinyl heads and limbs attached to soft cloth bodies stuffed with cotton or synthetic fiber, providing both durability and huggability.

Baby dolls typically range from 8 to 20 inches in length and are designed to resemble infants, with rounded faces, closed or sleeping eyes, and proportions mimicking real babies. Fashion dolls are generally smaller (around 11-12 inches) with adult body proportions and articulated joints that allow for posing and clothing changes. Cloth and rag dolls are made entirely from fabric, often stuffed with soft filling, making them lightweight and washable.

Dolls may include features such as rooted or molded hair (made from nylon or other synthetic fibers), painted or inset eyes, and clothing that can be removed and changed. Some dolls include interactive elements like mechanisms that produce sounds, allow feeding with toy bottles, or simulate other caregiving activities.

Historical dolls were crafted from available materials including wood, clay, porcelain, bisque (unglazed ceramic), wax, and corn husks. Traditional and cultural dolls continue to use diverse materials and represent specific regional or ethnic traditions, such as Russian matryoshka nesting dolls, Japanese kokeshi dolls, and Native American corn husk dolls.

## How Kids Play

Children interact with dolls primarily through imitative and imaginative play centered on caregiving and social scenarios. The most common play patterns involve:

**Nurturing play**: Children feed dolls with toy bottles, change their clothing or diapers, put them to bed, push them in toy strollers, and carry them in their arms. This mimics caregiving behaviors children observe in their own lives.

**Narrative play**: Children create stories and scenarios involving their dolls, assigning names, personalities, and relationships. Dolls become characters in ongoing fictional worlds that children develop over time, often incorporating multiple dolls interacting with each other.

**Domestic role-play**: Children use dolls to act out household scenes, playing parent, sibling, or family member. Dolls serve as stand-ins for babies or children in these scenarios while the child takes on an adult caregiver role.

**Social play**: When playing with other children, dolls become shared characters in collaborative storytelling. Children negotiate roles and storylines together, with each child controlling one or more doll characters.

**Dressing and styling**: Particularly with fashion dolls, children spend time changing outfits, styling hair, and arranging accessories. This may involve organizing doll wardrobes and creating outfits for different imagined occasions.

**Dollhouse play**: Dolls are often used alongside dollhouses and miniature furniture, where children arrange domestic scenes and move dolls through rooms acting out daily routines.

Play patterns evolve with age. Infants and young toddlers primarily hold, cuddle, and carry dolls for comfort. From around 18 months to 2 years, children begin simple pretend play like feeding the doll. Preschool-age children develop more elaborate narratives and scenarios. School-age children may engage in complex multi-character storylines or transition interest toward specialized dolls such as fashion dolls or collectible figures.

## Notes

The doll category encompasses an extremely broad range of products with different purposes. Baby dolls emphasize caregiving play, fashion dolls emphasize dress-up and lifestyle imagination, character dolls tie into media franchises, and soft dolls prioritize comfort and portability. These subcategories attract different age groups and play styles.

Notable branded examples in the baby doll category include Baby Alive, Baby Born, and La Newborn. Fashion dolls include Barbie (introduced 1959), Bratz, Monster High, Rainbow High, and LOL Surprise. Soft doll traditions include Raggedy Ann (1918), Cabbage Patch Kids (1983), and various Waldorf-style cloth dolls. The American Girl Collection (1986) represents historical and contemporary character dolls with accompanying books and accessories.

Doll accessories form a significant secondary market, including clothing, furniture, vehicles, playsets, and caregiving items like bottles, cribs, and strollers. Many children accumulate collections of dolls and accessories over time.

The age at which children lose interest in doll play varies considerably, with some children continuing imaginative doll play into the preteen years while others transition away earlier. Children who stop traditional play may shift interest to collectible or display dolls rather than abandoning the category entirely.

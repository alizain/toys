The Step2 Up & Down Roller Coaster is a ride-on toy consisting of a small coaster car and a track with an elevated platform. It is manufactured by Step2 in the United States using domestic and imported parts. The toy is designed for indoor or outdoor use.

## What It Is

The set includes a three-piece riding track, a coaster car, and a platform with steps. When assembled, the track measures approximately 10 feet in length, with overall dimensions of 12.75 inches high, 110 inches wide, and 27 inches deep. The platform features wide, non-slip stairs leading to the top, where the coaster car rests in recessed wells. The car itself has a high back, a front handrail, and molded-in footrests. The maximum weight capacity is 50 pounds. The track pieces can be disassembled for storage.

## How Kids Play

Children climb the platform stairs, sit in the coaster car, and ride down the track. The track has a gentle slope with rises and dips along its length. After reaching the bottom, children typically push the car back up to the platform for another ride. The car can also be used off the track as a foot-to-floor ride-on toy. The activity involves climbing, sitting, balancing, and pushing, which engages gross motor skills and coordination.

## Notes

The platform steps are positioned in the center, allowing children to push the car up one side of the track while walking up the stairs alongside it. An expansion track (sold separately) can extend the ride by an additional 4 feet. The product comes in several themed variations, including unicorn and airplane versions, though the core design and dimensions remain similar across the line.

A tricycle is a three-wheeled pedal-powered vehicle designed for young children. The configuration features one large front wheel with attached pedals and two smaller rear wheels, creating a stable platform that does not require balancing. Tricycles have been manufactured for children since the late 1800s and remain a common ride-on toy.

## What It Is

A children's tricycle has a single front wheel, typically 10 to 12 inches in diameter, connected directly to pedal cranks. The two rear wheels are smaller, usually 7 inches, and are mounted on a fixed axle beneath or behind the seat. The frame is commonly made of steel tubing, though some models use plastic. Handlebars connect to the front wheel fork for steering. The seat is positioned low to the ground and may be adjustable to accommodate growth. Many tricycles include a controlled turning radius that limits how sharply the front wheel can turn, reducing the risk of tipping during sharp turns.

Classic models often feature chrome-plated handlebars, spoke wheels with rubber tires, and decorative elements such as bells, streamers, or rear deck platforms. Some tricycles include a rear step or dual-deck design that allows a second child to stand while the rider pedals. Modern variations may use EVA foam wheels instead of rubber, which are puncture-resistant and quieter on indoor surfaces. Convertible models for younger toddlers sometimes include parent push handles and footrests for children who have not yet learned to pedal.

## How Kids Play

Learning to ride a tricycle involves several distinct phases. Children typically begin by sitting on the seat and scooting with their feet on the ground rather than using the pedals. This scooting phase allows them to become familiar with steering and the feel of the vehicle before attempting to pedal.

Pedaling is a learned motor skill that many children find challenging at first. The alternating push-push motion requires coordinating both legs in a circular rhythm while also steering. Children often look down at their feet when first learning, which can make steering erratic. Some children push backward initially before mastering the forward pedaling motion. Parents sometimes assist by gently pushing the tricycle while the child's feet rest on the pedals, allowing the child to feel the rotation before producing it independently.

Once children can pedal and steer simultaneously, they ride on driveways, sidewalks, and paved paths. Hard, flat surfaces work better than grass or gravel, which create resistance that makes pedaling difficult. Children often ride in circles or back and forth in contained areas. Older children may use the rear deck to give rides to siblings or stuffed animals.

## Notes

The American Academy of Pediatrics indicates most children are developmentally ready for a standard tricycle around age 3, though some begin as early as age 2 with appropriately sized models. Children typically transition away from tricycles between ages 4 and 6, often moving to balance bikes or bicycles with training wheels.

Tricycles sit low to the ground and have a wide wheelbase, making them stable but also difficult for adults to see in driveways. The pedal mechanism is simple and direct-drive, meaning the pedals rotate whenever the front wheel moves and cannot coast. Children stop by ceasing to pedal and placing their feet on the ground rather than using brakes.

Radio Flyer, founded in 1917, is one of the most recognized tricycle manufacturers in the United States. Their classic models have maintained similar designs for decades, featuring steel construction, chrome accents, and the distinctive red color that has become associated with the category.

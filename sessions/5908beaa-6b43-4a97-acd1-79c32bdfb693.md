## Main Topic

Making toy cards clickable to navigate to a detail page that renders the full markdown content for each toy.

---

## What Was Tried

1. **Initial approach (onClick handlers)**: The assistant first tried implementing onClick handlers on ToyCard with a modal-based ToyDetail component. This included:
   - Installing react-markdown package
   - Adding onClick prop to ToyCard interface
   - Creating a ToyDetail modal component with backdrop blur

2. **User course correction**: The user interrupted and requested a simpler approach - just wrap components in Next.js `<Link>` elements instead of implementing custom onClick handlers.

3. **Final approach (Next.js routing)**: The assistant pivoted to using Next.js navigation:
   - Wrapped ToyCard in `<Link href={/toys/${toy.slug}}>`
   - Created a dynamic route at `/toys/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - Used react-markdown to render content on the detail page

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Files Modified:
- `/packages/toys/components/toy-card.tsx` - Replaced article element with Link component pointing to `/toys/[slug]`

### Files Created:
- `/packages/toys/app/toys/[slug]/page.tsx` - New dynamic route page with:
  - Back navigation link to home
  - Toy header with name and external link
  - Score badge with color-coded rating (Excellent/Great/Good)
  - Rating section displaying all 7 dimensions
  - Markdown rendering of full toy content

### Files Deleted:
- `/packages/toys/components/toy-detail.tsx` - Removed unused modal component from initial approach

### Build Verification:
Build passed successfully with the new `/toys/[slug]` route showing as dynamic.

---

## Key Insights

- **Simplicity over complexity**: The user preferred standard Next.js routing patterns over custom modal/onClick implementations
- **Component reuse**: Rating bars and score badge display logic was replicated in the detail page (could be extracted to shared components in future)
- **Dynamic routing**: The page uses `params: Promise<{ slug: string }>` pattern for Next.js 15+ async params

---

## Open Questions

- Rating display logic (getTotalScoreColor, getTotalScoreLabel, getScoreLabelStyle) is duplicated between toy-card.tsx and the detail page - could be extracted to a shared utility
- The toy-detail.tsx component was created and then deleted - no indication if this pattern might be useful later for modal views

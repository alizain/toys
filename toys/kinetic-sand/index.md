Kinetic Sand is a moldable sand product manufactured by Spin Master Ltd. The sand has a distinctive texture that allows it to hold shapes when compressed while flowing loosely when released. It does not dry out over time and leaves hands dry after handling.

## What It Is

Kinetic Sand consists of 98% natural sand combined with 2% of a proprietary non-toxic polymer binding agent. This combination creates sand that sticks to itself rather than to hands or surfaces. The sand has a slightly silky texture and moves with an almost fluid quality when poured or manipulated. It comes in natural sand color as well as various dyed colors. A variant called Beach Sand uses larger grain sizes. The product is wheat-free, gluten-free, and casein-free.

## How Kids Play

Children typically engage with Kinetic Sand through several observable play patterns:

- **Molding and shaping**: Pressing the sand into forms, molds, or freehand shapes. The sand holds its shape when compressed and releases cleanly from molds.
- **Cutting and slicing**: Using plastic knives or similar tools to cut through formed sand. The sand separates cleanly along cut lines.
- **Cookie cutter shapes**: Pressing cutters into flattened sand to create two-dimensional shapes.
- **Squishing and flowing**: Repeatedly compressing and releasing the sand to watch it flow and reform.
- **Burying and finding**: Hiding small objects within the sand and digging to retrieve them.
- **Impression making**: Pressing objects into the sand surface to create imprints and patterns.

## Notes

The sand requires a contained play area, as loose grains do spread despite the self-sticking property. The polymer component gives the sand a faint smell that some users notice. Over time and with heavy use, the sand can pick up debris and lose some of its cohesive properties. Mixing different colors together will eventually blend into a single combined color. The sand stores indefinitely in a sealed container.

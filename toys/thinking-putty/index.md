Thinking Putty is a silicone-based putty sold in small metal tins. Produced by Crazy Aaron Enterprises since 1998 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, it comes in dozens of varieties with different visual effects. The putty does not dry out over time due to its silicone composition.

## What It Is

Thinking Putty is a pliable, non-toxic silicone compound that can be stretched, bounced, torn, and shaped. It has a smooth, slightly tacky texture and returns to a blob shape when left undisturbed. The putty comes in 4-inch tins (approximately 90 grams) and smaller mini tins. Varieties include color-shifting versions, glow-in-the-dark formulas, glitter-infused options, heat-sensitive types that change color with temperature, magnetic versions containing iron particles, and transparent "liquid glass" styles. The putty contains no latex, gluten, wheat compounds, or phthalates.

## How Kids Play

Children stretch the putty between their hands, roll it into balls and bounce it, and fold it over itself to create air pockets that pop when squeezed. Some press objects into it to make impressions or pull it into long strings. The putty can be shaped into temporary sculptures, though these gradually slump back into formless masses. Kids with magnetic varieties use included magnets to move the putty or watch it slowly engulf small metal objects. Heat-sensitive versions invite repeated handling to observe color transitions from body warmth. The putty often ends up as a fidget object during homework, car rides, or waiting rooms. Over extended use, the putty accumulates lint and hair from the environment.

## Notes

The standard product is rated for ages 3 and up, though magnetic putty and DIY mixing kits are designated for ages 8 and up due to small parts. The silicone material can stick to fabric and hair if pressed into them. Parents report the putty lasting months to years with regular use before accumulating enough debris to warrant replacement. The company emphasizes the product's use as a sensory and focus tool. The tins are made from food-grade recyclable metal.

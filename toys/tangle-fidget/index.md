The Tangle is a fidget toy consisting of interconnected curved segments that pivot at each joint. Originally designed as a sculpture by artist Richard X Zawitz in the 1970s, the toy entered commercial production in 1981. The name derives from a combination of "tangent" and "angle."

## What It Is

A Tangle consists of approximately 18-20 curved plastic sections, each bent at a 90-degree angle, connected end-to-end in a continuous loop. The joints allow each segment to rotate freely relative to its neighbors. When coiled, a standard Tangle Jr. measures roughly 1.5 by 2 inches; extended, it stretches to about 7 inches. The segments are made from ABS plastic, sometimes coated with a textured rubber material. Some versions feature metallic finishes, textured bumps, or thermochromic surfaces that change color with heat.

## How Kids Play

Children manipulate Tangles by twisting, coiling, and reshaping the connected segments. Common actions include winding the loop into compact forms, stretching it out, threading it between fingers, and folding it into various configurations. The toy produces minimal sound during use. Some children separate sections and reconnect them in different color arrangements. The continuous loop has no fixed starting point, so there is no single "correct" way to hold or orient it.

## Notes

Individual curved sections can detach, presenting a choking hazard for children under 3 years old. The toy was initially sold as a sculptural gift item in stores like Bloomingdale's before entering the toy market through Kmart in 1989. Various specialty versions exist, including the Therapy Tangle with raised tactile bumps and softer rubber coating, designed for sensory input. The product gained renewed visibility during the 2017 fidget spinner trend and again through social media in 2020.

A gymnastics mat is a padded surface designed for tumbling, rolling, and practicing basic gymnastics movements at home or in structured settings. These mats typically fold into panels for storage and unfold to create a cushioned exercise area. They range from compact single-child sizes to longer runway-style configurations.

## What It Is

A children's gymnastics mat consists of a foam core encased in a durable outer covering. The foam is typically cross-linked polyethylene (around 1.375 inches thick) or polyurethane (often 2 inches thick), with densities ranging from 28-33 kg/m3. The outer covering is usually 14-18 oz vinyl-reinforced polyester or PVC leather, designed to be water-resistant and wipeable. Common dimensions include 4x6 feet, 4x8 feet, and 2x8 feet, though sizes vary. Panel mats fold at seams where foamless gaps allow the mat to compress. Many mats include velcro strips along the edges to connect multiple units end-to-end. Some versions feature printed hand and foot guides, while others are solid-colored.

## How Kids Play

Children use these mats for forward rolls, backward rolls, cartwheels, handstands, and bridge poses. Younger children (ages 3-5) often treat incline or wedge-shaped mats as slides or climbing surfaces. When multiple mats are arranged, children create obstacle courses or play games where the mats become "islands" and the surrounding floor becomes "water." Some children practice dance moves, stretching, or simply somersault repeatedly. The mat also serves as a designated space for roughhousing that might otherwise occur on furniture or hard floors. Children often fold and unfold panel mats as part of setup and cleanup routines.

## Notes

Folding panel mats store more compactly than roll-out mats but show visible seams when unfolded. The mat surface becomes slippery when wet or with certain sock materials. Foam compresses over time with regular use, particularly at fold lines. Mats intended for home use are generally thinner (1-2 inches) than those used in gymnastics facilities. The vinyl smell on new mats dissipates after several days of off-gassing. Weight varies significantly by size and foam density, affecting how easily children can move or fold the mat independently.

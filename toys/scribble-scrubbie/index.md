Scribble Scrubbie Pets are small animal figurines with a white flocked surface that children can color with washable markers. The core play loop involves decorating the pets, then washing them clean and starting over. The line includes various playsets with tubs, brushes, and themed accessories.

## What It Is

Each figurine stands approximately 2-3 inches tall and features a plastic body covered in a layer of tiny fibers (flocking) that creates a soft, fuzzy texture. The flocked coating holds marker ink and releases it when scrubbed with water. The figures come in blank white, pink, or blue coats depending on the set. Animal varieties include cats, dogs, bunnies, and "Peculiar Pets" such as unicorns, dragons, narwhals, and yetis. Playsets typically include a small tub or basin, a scrub brush, and several washable markers.

## How Kids Play

Children use the included washable markers to draw patterns, colors, and designs onto the flocked surface of the figurines. The markers glide across the fuzzy texture and produce visible color. When ready to start over, children place the pet in water, use the scrub brush to release the ink from the fibers, and let the figure dry. This color-wash-repeat cycle can be done multiple times. Some sets include working spray pumps or shower heads that circulate water for rinsing. Children often role-play pet grooming scenarios, treating the wash cycle as a bath or salon visit.

## Notes

The washable markers are the same Ultra-Clean formula Crayola uses in other products, designed to wash from skin and most fabrics. The flocking can hold ink residue over time, especially with darker colors, which may leave a faint tint after washing. The figurines have names and printed personalities in the included materials, though many children assign their own. A companion mobile app allows children to scan physical pets and interact with digital versions. The product line has expanded to include themed playsets (grooming trucks, treehouses, salons) that are compatible with figures from other sets.

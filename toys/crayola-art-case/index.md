A Crayola Art Case is a portable art supply kit that bundles multiple coloring and drawing tools into a single carrying case. The case functions as both storage and transport, with a hinged lid, handle, and latches that allow children to keep their supplies organized and take them to different locations.

## What It Is

The most common version is the Crayola Inspiration Art Case, which contains approximately 140 pieces. A typical set includes 64 crayons, 40 washable markers, 20 short colored pencils, and 15 sheets of drawing paper (approximately 9" x 13"). The case itself is made of molded plastic, measuring roughly 15.5" x 11" x 2" when closed. It features two locking latches, a folding carry handle, and interior trays with compartments that hold each type of supply separately.

Crayola produces several variations of the art case:

- **Inspiration Art Case** (140 pieces) - The standard version with crayons, markers, colored pencils, and paper
- **Smart Case Next Generation** (150+ pieces) - Includes Pip Squeaks markers and additional marker varieties
- **All That Glitters Art Case** (50+ pieces) - Focused on metallic and glitter supplies including glitter crayons, metallic crayons, glitter glue, and glitter chalk
- **Imagination Art Set** (115 pieces) - Includes rubbing plates for creating textured effects
- **Limited Edition Art Case** - Features retired crayon colors and collectible elements

Themed versions have been released featuring licensed characters including Mickey Mouse, The Incredibles, Minions, Finding Dory, and Trolls. Some versions are retailer exclusives with different case graphics (such as space or tie-dye patterns).

## How Kids Play

Children use the art case for drawing, coloring, and general mark-making activities. The variety of tools means children can switch between media within a single drawing session, using crayons for broad coverage, colored pencils for detail work, and markers for bold lines.

The portability of the case makes it suitable for use in multiple contexts: at home, in the car, at restaurants, during travel, or at a relative's house. Children often carry it to activities like a personal art studio. The included paper provides an immediate surface for drawing, though children commonly use the supplies with coloring books or blank paper they already have.

Younger children (ages 4-5) tend to use the supplies for free exploration and scribbling, while older children (ages 6-8) may work on more deliberate drawings or coloring projects. The case format encourages children to manage their own supplies, returning items to designated slots after use.

Play is typically individual, though siblings or friends sometimes share a case or compare drawings made with the same supplies.

## Notes

The case design prioritizes organization and transport over workspace. The interior trays lift out, but there is no built-in drawing surface. Children need a separate flat surface to work on.

The "washable" designation on markers refers to their ability to be cleaned from skin and most fabrics, which addresses a common parent concern with marker-based art supplies.

The 140-piece count includes every individual item (each crayon, each marker, each sheet of paper), not 140 distinct products. The crayons alone typically account for nearly half the total count.

Short colored pencils are included rather than full-length pencils, which keeps them proportionate to the case size but may be less comfortable for older children or adults to grip.

Crayola art cases have been sold internationally. According to collector documentation, the Inspiration Art Case was notably one of the few Crayola products with large crayon assortments available in the United Kingdom after the Crayola Europe factory closed in 2003.

Ravensburger is a German company that has manufactured jigsaw puzzles since 1891. Their children's line ranges from two-piece puzzles for toddlers to 300-piece puzzles for older children. The company produces puzzles at their facility in Ravensburg, Germany, using proprietary die-cutting tools and cardboard formulations.

## What It Is

Ravensburger children's puzzles are made from layered cardboard with a linen-textured paper surface that reduces glare. The cardboard thickness varies by product line, with toddler puzzles using extra-thick, double-laminated board. Pieces are die-cut using hand-crafted steel tools, which the company claims produces a distinct fit they call "Softclick" - an audible snap when pieces connect correctly.

The "My First Puzzles" line for children 18 months and up includes sets of four puzzles with progressive piece counts (2, 3, 4, and 5 pieces) or sets of nine two-piece puzzles. Each completed puzzle in this line measures approximately 16.5 x 11.5 cm. The pieces are chunky and designed for small hands to grasp.

For older children, piece counts increase: 60 pieces for ages 4+, 100 pieces (XXL format with larger pieces, completing at 49 x 36 cm) for ages 6+, 200 pieces for ages 8+, and 300 pieces for ages 9+. Subject matter includes licensed characters (Bluey, Paw Patrol, Star Wars, Disney), animals, vehicles, fantasy themes like dragons and unicorns, and educational subjects like the solar system. The company also produces 3D puzzles with curved plastic pieces that form globes and structures.

## How Kids Play

Toddlers working on two-piece puzzles typically match pieces through trial and error, rotating and flipping pieces until they connect. Around age three, children continue to rely on trial-and-error methods. Research indicates that around age four, children begin using visual information from the picture to guide placement - examining colors, patterns, and image content to predict where pieces belong.

Children commonly start by finding edge pieces to build a frame, then work inward. Some children sort pieces by color or section of the image before assembling. Parents and caregivers often sit alongside younger children, offering spatial language like "turn," "flip," and "rotate," or pointing out visual details that help match pieces.

Puzzle sessions vary in length depending on piece count and child experience. A 24-piece puzzle might occupy a preschooler for 15-30 minutes, while a 100-piece puzzle can extend across multiple sessions. Some children disassemble completed puzzles immediately to rebuild them; others leave finished puzzles on display before returning them to the box. Siblings and friends sometimes work on puzzles together, dividing sections or taking turns placing pieces.

## Notes

Completed puzzles do not stay assembled without glue or a frame; pieces separate when moved. Storage requires keeping all pieces together in the original box or a container, as missing pieces cannot be replaced individually.

Children who struggle with jigsaw puzzles may have difficulty with visual discrimination (distinguishing similar colors or patterns), figure-ground perception (finding a specific detail among many pieces), or motor planning (knowing where to begin). Some children prefer puzzles with distinct, high-contrast images over complex scenes with uniform colors.

The puzzles use FSC-certified materials from sustainably managed forests. Ravensburger states that safety of materials is verified by an independent testing institute. The cardboard and paper components are recyclable.

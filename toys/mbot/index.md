The mBot is an entry-level programmable robot kit produced by Makeblock, a Chinese educational technology company. It consists of a wheeled chassis with integrated sensors and a microcontroller board, designed to be assembled and programmed by children. The kit is widely used in classrooms and homes for introducing basic robotics and block-based coding.

## What It Is

The mBot is a small two-wheeled robot measuring approximately 17 x 13 x 9 cm when assembled and weighing around 1 kg with batteries. The main body consists of a powder-coated aluminum alloy chassis that holds the mCore control board, which is based on the Arduino Uno microcontroller. Two DC motors drive rubber wheels independently, allowing differential steering, while a small caster ball at the rear provides balance.

The robot includes several integrated sensors: an ultrasonic distance sensor mounted at the front (which resembles a pair of eyes), a line-following sensor on the underside with two infrared emitter-detector pairs, a light sensor, an infrared receiver for the included remote control, and a button. Output components include a buzzer, two RGB LEDs, and an infrared transmitter. Four RJ25 ports allow connection to additional Makeblock sensors and modules.

The kit comes with approximately 38 parts including the chassis, mCore board, two motors with wheels, ultrasonic sensor, line follower sensor, screws, standoffs, cables, a screwdriver, an infrared remote control, and a battery holder. Power comes from either four AA batteries or an optional 3.7V lithium battery pack. Assembly takes roughly 15-30 minutes using the included instructions.

## How Kids Play

Children typically engage with the mBot in two distinct ways. Younger children and those new to the kit often use the infrared remote control to drive the robot around like a car, steering it through rooms and around obstacles. The robot can also be set to preset modes including autonomous line-following along dark lines on light surfaces, and obstacle avoidance using the ultrasonic sensor.

Programming becomes the primary activity for many children as they gain familiarity. Using mBlock software (a Scratch-based visual programming environment), children drag and drop code blocks to control the robot's movements, sounds, and LED colors. Common early programs include making the robot drive in geometric patterns, respond to claps or light levels, play musical tones, or navigate mazes. The ultrasonic sensor enables programs where the robot detects and avoids walls or follows a moving hand at a set distance.

In classroom and group settings, children often create games and challenges with their robots. Observed activities include races along tape tracks, sumo-style pushing contests, and balloon-popping games where robots attempt to burst balloons attached to opponents while protecting their own. Children also program robots to respond to events on a connected computer, creating interactive projects that combine screen-based and physical elements.

## Notes

The robot's face-like appearance, with the ultrasonic sensor forming two prominent eyes, tends to prompt immediate curiosity from children. The labeled ports and slot-in connectors reduce wiring confusion during both assembly and expansion.

When multiple mBots operate in the same space using infrared remotes, signals from one remote can affect nearby robots, which can create confusion or unintended interactions. Bluetooth versions avoid this issue.

Motor performance can vary between units, occasionally causing robots to pull slightly to one side rather than driving straight. This becomes noticeable during remote control play but can be compensated for in programmed movements.

The four-AA-battery configuration drains relatively quickly during active use. The rechargeable lithium battery option provides longer run times and is common in classroom deployments.

The kit is compatible with Lego Technic pieces and Makeblock's broader ecosystem of structural parts and electronic modules, which allows for significant physical modification and expansion beyond the basic wheeled robot configuration.

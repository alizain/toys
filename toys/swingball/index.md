Swingball is a tethered ball game where two players hit a ball around a central pole using small racquets. The game has been manufactured since 1974 and is particularly associated with backyard play in the United Kingdom. It is also known as totem tennis or tether tennis in other regions.

## What It Is

A swingball set consists of a vertical pole, typically around 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall, made from interlocking plastic or metal sections. At the top of the pole sits a helical wire coil through which a cord passes, with a ball attached to its end. The cord allows the ball to travel up or down the spiral as players strike it in opposite directions. The pole is anchored either by pushing it into soft ground or by attaching it to a base that can be filled with sand or water for stability on hard surfaces. Two lightweight plastic racquets, similar in shape to small tennis rackets, are included for hitting the ball. Depending on the variant, the ball may be a standard tennis ball, a softer foam ball for younger children, or a ball specifically designed for the set.

## How Kids Play

Two players stand on opposite sides of the pole, each assigned a direction (clockwise or anticlockwise). Players take turns hitting the ball with their racquets, attempting to wind the cord around the spiral toward their designated end (top or bottom). The opposing player tries to reverse the ball's direction by striking it the other way. A point or game is won when one player successfully winds the ball to their end of the spiral. Rallies can become rapid as the ball gains momentum, requiring players to react quickly. Younger children may initially chase the ball around the pole rather than maintaining position, while older players tend to develop timing and positioning strategies. The game is typically played outdoors on lawns, patios, beaches, or other open spaces.

## Notes

The Mookie Toys company acquired the Swingball brand in 1993, though the product had been sold since 1974. Several variants exist for different age groups: Junior Swingball uses a shorter pole and softer ball for ages 3-5, while Pro versions feature taller poles and faster ball action. Tennis player Andy Murray has mentioned playing swingball as a child. The game requires moderate space, as the ball swings in a radius around the pole. Wind can affect gameplay, particularly with lighter foam balls. The spiral mechanism distinguishes branded Swingball sets from traditional tetherball, where the rope simply wraps around a smooth pole.

PJ Masks action figures are small plastic toys based on the animated television series of the same name, which premiered in 2015. The show follows three children who transform into superheroes at night: Catboy, Owlette, and Gekko. The figures represent both the hero characters and their recurring villains, including Romeo, Luna Girl, and Night Ninja.

## What It Is

Standard PJ Masks figures stand approximately 3 inches tall. They feature poseable arms and legs, with joints allowing basic positioning. The figures are made primarily of molded plastic, though some elements like Owlette's cape use softer rubber materials. Hero characters often come with attachable accessories corresponding to their powers, such as Catboy's stripes or Owlette's feathers. Villain figures similarly include character-specific items like Luna Girl's Luna Board.

Sets range from individual figures to multi-packs containing up to 16 pieces. Common configurations include hero-and-villain pairs, full team sets with all three main heroes, and deluxe collections featuring both heroes and villains with multiple accessories. Some figures are designed to work with Hasbro's Hero ID technology, which triggers lights and sounds when placed on compatible playsets.

## How Kids Play

Children commonly use these figures for imaginative scenarios drawn from the television show. The heroes are positioned against villains in confrontations, with children narrating or acting out storylines. The small size makes the figures portable, and they frequently accompany children in bags or pockets.

Play often involves recreating specific episodes or inventing new adventures. Children assign dialogue to different characters, moving them through conflict and resolution sequences. The figures also get combined with vehicles and playsets from the same product line, such as the Cat-Car or headquarters playset. Some children sort and arrange the figures by hero or villain designation, or display them as collections.

## Notes

The 3-inch scale has become the standard size for this product line, creating compatibility across different sets and playsets. Earlier figures produced by Just Play and later ones produced by Hasbro maintain similar proportions. The Hero ID feature only functions with designated electronic playsets; the figures themselves do not contain batteries or electronics. Small accessories present a choking hazard, which limits use with children under 3 years old. The figures reflect character designs from the animated series, including costume colors and distinctive features like Catboy's ears or Gekko's tail.

A weighted blanket is a therapeutic blanket designed to provide deep pressure stimulation across a child's body. The blanket contains evenly distributed fill material, typically micro glass beads or plastic pellets, that makes it substantially heavier than a standard blanket. Weighted blankets for children typically range from 4 to 15 pounds and are used as a sensory calming tool.

## What It Is

A children's weighted blanket consists of an outer fabric shell filled with small weighted materials sewn into individual compartments. The compartments, which range from 2x2 inches to 5x5 inches depending on the design, prevent the fill from shifting and ensure even weight distribution across the blanket's surface.

The outer fabric is typically made from cotton, microfiber, flannel, or minky (a soft plush material). Some blankets feature different textures on each side, such as smooth cotton on one side and textured minky on the other. The fill material is most commonly micro glass beads, which resemble fine sand and create a smooth, non-lumpy texture. Some blankets use plastic poly pellets instead.

Children's weighted blankets come in smaller dimensions than adult versions, commonly 36x48 inches or 41x72 inches. Weights range from 5 to 12 pounds, with the general guideline being approximately 10 percent of the child's body weight. A child weighing 50 pounds would typically use a 5-pound blanket.

## How Kids Play

Children use weighted blankets primarily during rest, relaxation, and focused activities rather than active play. A child might drape the blanket over their lap while reading, drawing, or watching television. The weight provides a grounding sensation that can help children remain seated and focused during table-top activities.

During bedtime routines, children lie under the blanket as they would with any bedding. The distributed pressure across the body produces a sensation often compared to being hugged. Some children use weighted blankets during car rides or in environments they find overstimulating.

Younger children (ages 4-6) typically use lighter blankets (5-7 pounds) and may need adult assistance positioning and removing them. Older children can manage heavier blankets independently and may incorporate them into self-regulation routines when feeling anxious or overwhelmed.

This is primarily a solo-use item. Children do not typically share weighted blankets or use them in group activities.

## Notes

Weight selection matters significantly. A blanket that is too heavy can feel restrictive rather than calming, while one that is too light may not provide noticeable benefit. The 10 percent body weight guideline is a starting point, not a strict rule.

The quality of fill distribution varies considerably between products. Smaller compartments (2x2 inches) keep beads more evenly spread than larger compartments (8x8 inches), which can result in beads pooling in corners.

Glass beads are quieter than plastic pellets when the blanket moves. This matters for children sensitive to sound.

Weighted blankets are not recommended for children under age 4 due to suffocation risk. Medical professionals and occupational therapists often recommend consulting before use, particularly for children with respiratory conditions or motor impairments that might prevent them from removing the blanket independently.

These blankets require specific washing instructions. Many have removable covers to make cleaning easier, as the weighted inner blanket can be difficult to machine wash due to its weight.

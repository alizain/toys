Gravity Maze is a single-player logic puzzle game manufactured by ThinkFun (now under Ravensburger). Players arrange translucent plastic towers on a grid to create a path for a marble to travel from a starting position to a target tower. The game includes 60 challenge cards of increasing difficulty.

## What It Is

The game consists of a plastic game grid, nine translucent colored towers of varying heights, one red target piece, three steel marbles, and 60 challenge cards. Each tower contains internal ramps positioned at different angles on each level. The towers snap into the grid base, allowing them to be repositioned as players work through puzzles. The challenge cards display a starting configuration with a marked entry point and target destination, along with color hints indicating which tower pieces are needed to solve each puzzle.

## How Kids Play

A child selects a challenge card and sets up the initial configuration shown on the card. They then determine which additional towers to place and how to orient them so the marble will roll from the starting point through the ramps to reach the target tower. The marble is dropped into the top of the starting tower and gravity carries it through the constructed path. If the marble does not reach the target, the child adjusts tower placement or orientation and tries again. Solutions are printed on the back of each card. The 60 challenges progress from beginner through intermediate to expert difficulty levels.

## Notes

The game works as a marble run where the construction is the puzzle rather than an open-ended building activity. The translucent plastic allows players to see the marble's path through the towers. Tower placement requires considering both horizontal position on the grid and the rotational orientation of the internal ramps. The steel marbles are small and the packaging includes a choking hazard warning for children under 3.

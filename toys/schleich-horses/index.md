Schleich Horse Club figures are hand-painted plastic horse figurines produced by the German toy manufacturer Schleich, headquartered in Schwabisch Gmund. The company released its first horse figure in 1975 and launched the Horse Club product line in 2016. The figures are produced at 1:24 scale, with typical horse figurines measuring approximately 13cm high by 15cm long.

## What It Is

Each Schleich horse figure is an injection-molded PVC figurine that undergoes hand painting at manufacturing facilities across multiple countries including Germany, China, Spain, Portugal, Tunisia, Bosnia, and Romania. The production process begins with digital modeling, followed by creation of a resin prototype, then mold fabrication for injection molding. The PVC material is formulated to be bite-resistant, scratch-resistant, and saliva-resistant, using a plasticizer called Hexamoll DINCH developed by BASF. The figures comply with European Toy Directive 2009/48/EC and DIN EN 71 safety standards.

The Horse Club line encompasses individual horse figurines representing dozens of breeds including Friesian, Arabian, Andalusian, Hanoverian, Mustang, Quarter Horse, Appaloosa, Icelandic Pony, and Knabstrupper. The product range also includes human rider figurines (Hannah, Sofia, Lisa, and Sarah characters), playsets with stables and riding centers, and accessories such as trailers, grooming tools, hay bales, and feed items. Schleich consults with animal experts during the design process to inform the anatomical accuracy of each breed representation.

## How Kids Play

Children commonly arrange figures to construct stable and farm scenarios, positioning horses in paddocks, stalls, or outdoor settings. Play often involves pairing horse figures with rider figurines and acting out narratives around care routines such as feeding, grooming, and veterinary visits. The Horse Club storyline provides a framework centered on four friends in a village called Lakeside, though children frequently develop their own scenarios.

The figures integrate with accessory sets and larger playsets, allowing for expansion over time. Some children focus on collecting specific breeds or accumulating complete sets. The solid construction allows for outdoor play in sand, grass, and water settings. Older children and adults participate in collector communities, creating custom setups, dioramas, and photography with the figures. The figures are sometimes used alongside model horses from other manufacturers in mixed-scale play environments.

## Notes

Schleich retires figures periodically, creating a secondary market for discontinued breeds and color variations. The company has produced horse figures for approximately 50 years, and older figures from family collections sometimes appear alongside current production items. Some playsets include small parts that may present choking hazards for children under 3, though the individual horse figures themselves are generally solid pieces. The hand-painting process results in minor variation between individual figures of the same model.

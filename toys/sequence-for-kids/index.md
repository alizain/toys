Sequence for Kids is a children's adaptation of the Sequence board game, first published in 2001. Designed by Garrett J. Donner and Michael S. Steer, it replaces the standard playing card deck with animal-themed cards and reduces the winning sequence from five to four chips in a row. The game accommodates 2-4 players and typically takes 15-20 minutes to complete.

## What It Is

The game consists of a folding game board measuring approximately 39x50 cm, printed with a grid of animal illustrations. Each animal appears twice on the board. The deck contains 42 cards (55x86 mm), with two cards for each animal depicted on the board. Players receive 84 plastic chips divided evenly among four colors: red, yellow, green, and blue (21 of each). The four corners of the board feature free spaces that can be used by any player. The card deck includes two special card types: unicorn cards and dragon cards, distinguished by their fantasy creature illustrations rather than the standard animals.

## How Kids Play

Players each hold three cards in their hand. On a turn, a player selects one card from their hand, places a chip of their color on the matching animal space on the board, then draws a replacement card from the deck. When a player draws a unicorn card, they can place a chip on any open space. When a player draws a dragon card, they can remove one opponent's chip from the board. If a player holds a card where both matching board spaces are already covered by chips, they discard it and draw a new card. Play continues around the table until one player places four of their chips in a consecutive row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. With four players, the game becomes more contested as board space fills more quickly.

## Notes

The game requires no reading ability, as all matching is done through picture recognition. The mechanics parallel Connect Four in objective, though the card-drawing element introduces variability in which spaces a player can claim on any given turn. The dragon and unicorn cards create moments of disruption that can extend or shorten games unpredictably. The animal illustrations are cartoon-style renderings of common creatures. The board folds for storage but does not include a box insert or chip organizer.

Zingo is a bingo-style matching game made by ThinkFun, designed for pre-readers and early readers. Players race to match picture-and-word tiles to images on their personal game cards, with the first player to fill their card calling out "Zingo!" to win. The game accommodates 2-7 players and takes approximately 15-20 minutes to play.

## What It Is

The game centers on a plastic device called the "Zinger," which holds and dispenses tiles. When a player pushes the Zinger forward and pulls it back, two tiles slide out from slots on either side. The Zinger also serves as storage, with unclaimed tiles returned through a slot in the top.

The game includes:
- 1 plastic Zinger device
- 72 double-sided tiles featuring pictures with corresponding words printed below
- 6 double-sided Zingo cards (3x3 grids of images)
- Parent's guide and instructions

Each tile shows the same image on both sides, and there are three copies of each image in the tile set. The Zingo cards are two-sided with different difficulty levels: the green side has fewer overlapping images between players (less competitive), while the red side has more shared images (more competitive). Some editions include a seventh card to allow additional players.

## How Kids Play

One player acts as the dealer, operating the Zinger to reveal two tiles at a time. All players watch the tiles as they appear. When a player spots a tile matching an image on their card, they call out the image's name and claim the tile, placing it over the matching square on their card. If multiple players need the same tile, it goes to whoever calls it first. Unclaimed tiles get returned to the Zinger.

Younger children (around 3-4 years) can participate by recognizing pictures, though their attention span may limit them to one or two rounds before they become more interested in handling the tiles themselves. Children around 4-6 years engage with both the competitive element and the word recognition aspect. The tiles display words below each picture, so children who cannot yet read can play by matching images while simultaneously being exposed to the printed words.

The game is inherently social and competitive, though families often adapt it for cooperative play. The Zinger mechanism itself holds appeal for children, who enjoy the physical action of sliding it back and forth to reveal tiles.

## Notes

ThinkFun has developed several Zingo variants targeting specific skills: Zingo 1-2-3 (numbers and counting), Zingo Sight Words (common early-reading words), Zingo Time-Telling (clock faces and times), and Zingo Word Builder (spelling). There is also a travel version called Zingo To Go and expansion booster packs with additional tiles.

The two-sided cards with different competition levels represent a thoughtful design choice. The green side works well when playing with mixed ages or when a child is new to the game, while the red side creates more direct competition and contested tiles for experienced players.

The Zinger device serves multiple purposes: it randomizes tile order, creates anticipation as tiles are revealed, provides a tactile element that children enjoy, and keeps tiles organized during play and storage. The "easy cleanup" design means tiles can be loaded directly back into the Zinger when the game ends.

Makedo is a system of reusable plastic tools and connectors designed for building with cardboard. The tools allow children to cut, fold, punch holes in, and fasten cardboard pieces together without glue, tape, or staples. The company is based in Australia and emphasizes upcycling discarded cardboard as a construction material.

## What It Is

The system consists of several plastic tools and fasteners. The Safe-Saw has rounded edges and can cut through corrugated cardboard; one end of the handle serves as an awl for punching holes. The Scru-Driver is used to twist the plastic screws (called "Scrus") into cardboard layers. The Fold-Roller perforates one side of cardboard to create clean fold lines. Scrus come in two sizes: a 1/2-inch length that joins up to three layers of standard corrugated cardboard, and a 3/4-inch length for up to six layers or thicker material. The connectors can create both fixed joints and rotating hinges. Kits range from 50-piece sets for individual use to 360-piece sets intended for classroom groups. The tools store in a foldable cardboard carrier.

## How Kids Play

Children typically source cardboard from shipping boxes and packaging. They measure, cut, and fold pieces, then punch holes and fasten them with the plastic screws. Projects tend toward large-scale constructions: forts built around furniture, wearable costumes (dinosaurs, animals, vehicles), ride-in vehicles like trains and cars, and functional items like marble runs or foosball tables. Play sessions often run 30 minutes or longer as children work through construction challenges. The screws can be removed and repositioned, so children frequently disassemble and rebuild or modify existing structures. Group projects emerge naturally when larger kits are available, with children dividing tasks like cutting, hole-punching, and assembly.

## Notes

Newer versions of the Safe-Saw have a metal blade, which cuts more effectively than the earlier all-plastic design. Younger children (around age 5) may need help with sawing and sometimes with driving screws through multiple cardboard layers. The screws work with standard corrugated cardboard (the three-layer type common in shipping boxes); thinner cardstock or chipboard does not hold as well. Creating a hole with the awl tip before inserting a screw makes fastening easier. When given open-ended prompts, some children benefit from thematic constraints (build something from a specific story or setting) to get started. The tools meet safety standards for ages 3+ (ASTM F963, EN71), though the recommended age for independent use is 5+. Children ages 4 and under can participate with adult assistance.

Star Wars action figures are small poseable figurines depicting characters from the Star Wars film and television franchise. First produced by Kenner in 1978, these toys established the modern action figure market and were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2012. Production continues today through Hasbro across multiple product lines.

## What It Is

Star Wars action figures are manufactured in two primary scales: 3.75-inch and 6-inch. The 3.75-inch format originated with the Kenner line of the late 1970s, when oil shortages prompted manufacturers to reduce plastic usage by making figures smaller than competitors like G.I. Joe. These figures typically feature five points of articulation at the neck, shoulders, and hips. Modern lines such as The Vintage Collection offer higher articulation counts and more detailed sculpting while maintaining this traditional scale.

The 6-inch Black Series figures, introduced in 2013, provide larger formats with additional articulation points. Premium figures in this line sometimes incorporate cloth elements for clothing rather than molded plastic. Accessories commonly include weapons, helmets, and character-specific items. The figure lines span characters from all eras of the franchise, including the original trilogy, prequel trilogy, sequel trilogy, and various television series.

## How Kids Play

Children use Star Wars figures to stage narrative scenarios drawing from the films or inventing original stories. The small scale allows multiple figures to be gathered and positioned across available surfaces such as floors, tables, and furniture. Kids commonly create confrontations between protagonist and antagonist characters, positioning figures facing one another or arranging group scenes.

Figures are often combined with vehicles and playsets when available, expanding the staging possibilities. The 3.75-inch scale accommodates most vehicle interiors. Children move figures through sequences of action, providing voice dialogue and sound effects. Play sessions may recreate specific film scenes or develop entirely new scenarios using the characters as a starting cast.

The figures also appear in outdoor play, particularly in sandbox environments where terrain can be shaped. Bedroom shelves and display surfaces serve as staging areas between active play sessions.

## Notes

The 1970s oil shortage directly influenced the standard 3.75-inch scale that persists in toy lines today. This unintended consequence made the figures more affordable and portable than larger alternatives.

Adult collecting represents a significant portion of the market. The Vintage Collection line packages figures in retro-styled cardboard backing designed to evoke the original Kenner releases, appealing to nostalgia while the figures themselves feature modern articulation and detail.

The 6-inch Black Series figures have become the primary collector-focused line, with character selection emphasizing fan-requested characters and detailed sculpting of facial likenesses. The 3.75-inch Black Series was discontinued in 2017 after limited commercial success compared to its larger counterpart.

Figures are released in waves tied to film premieres, streaming series, and anniversary commemorations such as the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith in 2025.

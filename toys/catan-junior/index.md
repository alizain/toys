Catan Junior is a board game designed by Klaus Teuber and published by Catan Studio (formerly Mayfair Games) in 2012. It is a simplified, pirate-themed adaptation of the classic Settlers of Catan game, designed to introduce younger players to resource management and strategic gameplay. The game accommodates 2-4 players and typically takes around 30 minutes to complete.

## What It Is

Catan Junior features a double-sided game board depicting a ring of islands connected by sea routes. One side is configured for 2 players, while the other accommodates 3-4 players. The board includes named islands that produce different resources, plus a central "Spooky Island" where the Ghost Captain resides.

The game includes:
- 1 double-sided game board
- 28 pirate lairs (7 in each of 4 colors: typically red, blue, orange, and white)
- 32 ships (8 in each of 4 colors)
- 106 die-cut resource tiles representing five types: wood, goats, molasses, cutlasses, and gold
- 4 building cost reference tiles (one per player)
- 1 Ghost Captain figure
- 1 custom die with numbers and symbols
- 1 storage tray
- 1 rulebook

The pirate lairs and ships are made of plastic, while the resource tiles, game board, and reference cards are made of sturdy cardboard. The resource tiles are designed to lay flat on the table rather than be held in hand like cards, which accommodates younger players who may struggle to hold a hand of cards.

## How Kids Play

At the start of the game, each player places two pirate lairs on designated starting locations and receives initial resources. On each turn, a player rolls the die. If a number is rolled (3, 4, or 5), all players with pirate lairs adjacent to islands showing that number collect the corresponding resource tile. Special die faces trigger other effects: one allows moving a ship, another grants a free resource of choice.

Players spend resources to build ships and additional pirate lairs. Ships extend a player's network across the board, and new pirate lairs can only be built at locations connected by that player's ships. Building costs are displayed on each player's reference tile, eliminating the need to read or memorize rules.

Trading occurs in two ways: players can exchange resources with each other through negotiation, or they can use the marketplace on the board, which displays one of each resource type available for purchase using gold. Players can also acquire "Coco" parrot tiles that provide special abilities, such as moving the Ghost Captain or gaining resources.

The Ghost Captain functions as a gentler version of the robber from the original Catan. When moved to an island, it prevents that island from producing resources until moved again. Unlike the adult version, the Ghost Captain does not steal resources from other players.

The winner is the first player to build all seven of their pirate lairs. Because each player starts with two lairs already placed, they need to build five more during the game.

Children as young as 4 or 5 can learn the basics with adult guidance, though the recommended age is 6 and up. Younger children may focus on collecting resources and building, while older children begin to develop strategies around marketplace manipulation, trading, and Ghost Captain placement. The game requires no reading, making it accessible to pre-readers. Players must pay attention during others' turns because trading opportunities can arise at any time.

## Notes

The game has a complexity rating of 1.49 out of 5 on BoardGameGeek, placing it firmly in the "light" category suitable for family play. It won the 2013 Boardgames Australia Awards for Best Children's Game.

The design makes several deliberate accommodations for young players. Resource tiles rather than cards eliminate the fine motor challenge of holding a hand of cards. The Ghost Captain's mechanics are less punitive than the robber in adult Catan, reducing the potential for frustration or conflict between players. The fixed board layout (as opposed to the modular hex tiles in standard Catan) simplifies setup and ensures consistent game balance.

The rulebook includes optional advanced rules that can be introduced as children become more experienced, providing a progression path. Some families use Catan Junior as a stepping stone toward the full Catan game, introducing children to core concepts like resource collection, trading, and network building in a more accessible format.

The plastic ship and lair pieces are noted to be somewhat flexible, which may not hold up well if children fidget with or bend them during play. The cardboard components are more durable. Some families store pieces in bags rather than the included tray to keep them organized between plays.

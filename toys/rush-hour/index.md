Rush Hour is a single-player sliding block puzzle originally invented by Nob Yoshigahara in the 1970s under the name "Tokyo Parking." It was first commercially released in the United States in 1996 by Binary Arts (now ThinkFun, a Ravensburger company). The game presents players with traffic jam scenarios that must be solved by sliding vehicles to free a target car.

## What It Is

The game consists of a 6x6 plastic grid board with grooves that allow pieces to slide. An exit slot is positioned along one edge of the board. The set includes 16 plastic vehicles: one red car (the target vehicle), eleven additional cars, and four trucks. Cars occupy two grid squares in length while trucks occupy three; all vehicles are one square wide. The pieces are color-coded in various colors including blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, and beige. A set of 40 double-sided challenge cards comes with the game, each depicting a starting arrangement of vehicles. The board includes a built-in storage drawer for the pieces and cards.

## How Kids Play

A child selects a challenge card and arranges the vehicles on the grid according to the pattern shown. They then slide vehicles forward and backward along their fixed orientation—horizontal pieces move only left and right, vertical pieces move only up and down. Pieces cannot be rotated, lifted, or moved diagonally. The objective is to create a clear path for the red car to reach the exit slot. Children work through the four difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert), often starting easier cards and progressing to more complex configurations. Solutions are printed on the back of each card. Play is solitary, though children sometimes work together or take turns attempting challenges.

## Notes

The puzzle traces back to traditional sliding block puzzles but uses a traffic theme that gives the abstract problem a concrete narrative. The original wooden prototype was called "Tokyo Parking" before the commercial plastic version adopted the Rush Hour name and urban traffic framing. ThinkFun has released multiple variants over the years, including Rush Hour Jr. (simplified for younger children), Rush Hour Deluxe (with additional challenge cards), and travel editions. The game has received recognition from organizations including MENSA.

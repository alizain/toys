# Session Summary: eb94088a-a782-4bf4-a57c-c486019f0c53

**Session ID**: eb94088a-a782-4bf4-a57c-c486019f0c53
**Date/Timestamp**: December 26, 2025
**Main Topic**: Filter /rate page to only show toys with `version` key in frontmatter

## What was tried

The user wanted to update the `/rate` page to only consider toys that have a `version` key in their frontmatter. They referenced the `auto-rate.ts` script for potential code sharing.

## What was found/learned

**Rate page structure discovered:**
1. `app/rate/page.tsx` - Server component that loads toys and comparisons
2. `app/rate/rating-harness.tsx` - Client component with rating UI

**Key insight**: The filtering should happen at the `getToys()` level or when preparing `toyData`.

## Connection to other sessions

This relates to session 2bc878d7 where rating scripts were modified to filter by version.

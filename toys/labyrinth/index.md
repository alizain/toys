The labyrinth is a tabletop dexterity game in which players guide a steel marble through a maze by tilting the playing surface. Originating in Sweden, the game was first produced by BRIO in 1946 and has remained in continuous production since. The design has been replicated by numerous manufacturers, making it a recognizable fixture in toy collections worldwide.

## What It Is

A labyrinth consists of a wooden box with a maze board suspended inside. The maze surface features a network of pathways bordered by raised wooden walls, with numerous holes cut into the playing field. Two external knobs control separate axes of tilt, connected to the maze platform via an internal mechanism of pulleys and strings. Players receive one or two steel marbles. The classic BRIO version measures approximately 34cm x 39cm. The construction typically uses dovetailed wooden joints, and the playing surface sits level when the knobs are in their neutral positions.

## How Kids Play

Children grip the two control knobs and make small rotational adjustments to tilt the maze surface. The marble responds to gravity, rolling in the direction of the tilt. Players attempt to navigate the marble from the starting position through the winding path to the finish while avoiding the holes. When the marble drops through a hole, it falls into the box interior and must be retrieved to restart.

Children often adopt a slow, deliberate approach, making tiny adjustments and pausing to stabilize the marble before proceeding. Some players verbalize the path ahead or hold their breath during difficult sections. Repeated failures at the same hole are common, leading to visible frustration followed by renewed concentration. Players frequently restart from the beginning rather than from the point of failure. Older children sometimes time their runs or compete with siblings for the fastest completion. The game tends to produce focused, quiet play with occasional exclamations when the marble falls.

## Notes

The mechanism connecting the knobs to the maze platform is hidden from view, which can create confusion for younger children who may initially turn both knobs simultaneously rather than independently. The steel marble makes an audible rolling sound against the wooden surface, and a distinct clunk when it drops through a hole. Some versions include interchangeable maze boards with different difficulty levels. The game requires a flat, stable surface to function properly. Handheld enclosed versions exist with a transparent cover, eliminating the need for marble retrieval. The holes are sized slightly larger than the marble diameter, making near-misses possible where the marble circles a hole's edge before continuing or falling.

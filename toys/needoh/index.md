Nee Doh is a squeezable, stretchy ball filled with a soft, dough-like compound. Manufactured by Schylling, the product line includes various shapes and textures beyond the original ball form, including cubes, character shapes, and textured variants. The toys are marketed as sensory and fidget items.

## What It Is

The original Nee Doh is a round ball approximately 2.25 inches in diameter. The exterior is a smooth, stretchy membrane with a dry, non-sticky texture. Inside, a dense, pliable fill made from a PVA glue compound provides resistance when squeezed and allows the ball to return to its original shape after manipulation. The material is latex-free, BPA-free, and phthalate-free. Colors vary and are typically solid or swirled. Dust and lint can accumulate on the surface over time; the manufacturer recommends cleaning with soap and water.

## How Kids Play

Children squeeze the ball in their palm, applying pressure to feel the internal fill shift and compress. They pull and stretch the outer membrane, sometimes elongating the ball significantly before releasing it to watch it snap back. Some children knead it repeatedly in one hand, while others pass it between hands or press it against flat surfaces. The ball can be squished flat, twisted, or molded into temporary shapes that gradually return to round. During seated activities like reading or listening, children often manipulate Nee Doh without looking at it, keeping hands occupied while attention is directed elsewhere.

## Notes

The outer membrane can tear if stretched too aggressively or punctured by fingernails. If torn, the internal fill can leak out, and the product becomes unusable. The fill itself is described as non-toxic but can be messy if released. Product packaging includes a choking hazard warning for small parts. The line has expanded to include numerous variants with different textures (e.g., "Shaggy" with hair-like protrusions), visual effects (e.g., color-changing, glitter-filled), and shapes (e.g., gummy bears, ice cream cones, cubes). Each variant maintains the core squeeze-and-return mechanic with surface-level differences.

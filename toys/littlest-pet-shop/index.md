Littlest Pet Shop (LPS) is a collectible toy line owned by Hasbro, originally created by Kenner Products in 1992. The franchise consists of small animal figurines characterized by their large expressive eyes and bobble heads. Over 3,000 figurine variants have been released across multiple generations since the line's inception.

## What It Is

Littlest Pet Shop figures are small plastic animal figurines, typically standing around one inch tall. The figures feature oversized heads relative to their bodies, with large stylized eyes as a defining characteristic. Each figure has a bobble head mechanism that allows the head to move. Earlier generations included magnets on the bottom of the figures' feet, though these were replaced with peg holes in 2009. Current figures come in three sizes: teensie, mini, and classic. The toy line includes a wide variety of animal types including dogs, cats, and exotic animals such as capybaras and axolotls. Playsets and small plastic accessories are sold separately and alongside individual figures.

## How Kids Play

Children collect LPS figures individually and in sets, often seeking specific animals or rare variants. The figures are used in pretend play scenarios where children create stories and situations involving their pets. Playsets provide structured environments such as pet shops and homes where figures can be arranged and rearranged. The small scale and variety of figures supports imaginative world-building. Children trade figures with friends and peers, comparing collections and exchanging duplicates. The bobble head feature provides tactile interaction during play. Some children customize or display their collections rather than engaging in active play.

## Notes

The toy line has gone through seven distinct generations since 1992, with visual styles varying significantly between eras. Generation 2 figures (2004-2012) with their chunky bodies and bobble heads remain popular among collectors. The franchise was on hiatus from 2020 until Basic Fun! relaunched the line in 2024 under license from Hasbro. Adult collectors represent a notable portion of the consumer base alongside children. The line has spawned three animated television series and various video games. Current generation figures number over 220 distinct pets.

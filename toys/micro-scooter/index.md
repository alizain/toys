Micro is a Swiss-designed kick scooter brand that produces three-wheeled scooters for children. The company, Micro Mobility Systems AG, was founded in Switzerland and introduced the foldable kick scooter in 1999. Micro scooters are distributed internationally, with Micro Kickboard serving as the U.S. partner.

## What It Is

A Micro scooter consists of a standing platform (deck), a vertical T-bar handlebar, and three wheels arranged with two larger wheels in front and one smaller wheel in the rear. The Mini line, designed for children ages 2-5, features a deck approximately 12 inches long by 4.5 inches wide, adjustable handlebar height from roughly 17-27 inches, 120mm front wheels, and an 80mm rear wheel. The scooter weighs approximately 4.2 pounds with a maximum rider weight of 110 pounds.

The Maxi line, designed for children ages 5-12, features a larger deck at approximately 13 inches by 5.5 inches, handlebar height adjustable from 26-35 inches, and weighs approximately 5.5 pounds. The Maxi deck is constructed from flexible fiberglass-reinforced material that absorbs surface vibrations. Both lines feature silicone-injected deck surfaces for grip and anodized aluminum handlebars.

The wheels are made of polyurethane, a material that provides smooth rolling on paved surfaces. Some models include LED lights embedded in the wheels that illuminate through motion without batteries.

## How Kids Play

Children ride by standing with both feet on the deck and pushing off the ground with one foot while holding the T-bar. The scooter uses a lean-to-steer mechanism rather than turning handlebars: riders shift their body weight left or right to curve the scooter in that direction. This design requires children to use their body position for directional control rather than rotating the handlebar like a bicycle.

Children typically use Micro scooters on sidewalks, driveways, and paved paths. Common play patterns include scooting alongside walking adults, riding to school or nearby destinations, and circling in cul-de-sacs or parking lots. Children often ride in groups with other scootering or biking children. The portability of the scooter (some models fold, all are light enough for children to carry) allows it to be transported to parks or other locations.

Play sessions often involve continuous movement over distances, stopping to observe things of interest, and resuming riding. Some children incorporate the scooter into imaginative games, treating sidewalks as roads with rules. The brake is a rear fender that the rider presses down with their back foot.

## Notes

- The lean-to-steer mechanism was designed to develop balance and coordination skills, as children must shift their weight intuitively to turn, similar to the body mechanics used in skiing or surfing.

- Micro scooters are designed for smooth, dry surfaces. The polyurethane wheels do not perform well on wet pavement, gravel, or rough terrain.

- The Mini has a single rear wheel; the Maxi has two rear wheels positioned close together for additional stability with larger riders.

- The company offers convertible models (Mini 3in1, Mini2Grow) that include a removable seat and push handle, allowing children as young as 12 months to use the scooter as a ride-on before transitioning to standing.

- Replacement parts including wheels, brake pads, handlebar grips, and deck grip tape are available for maintenance and repair.

- The track dimensions of the scooter wheels are designed to navigate standard sidewalk widths. The company recommends riders stop at every street corner and dismount to cross.

- Production is based in China. The company is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.

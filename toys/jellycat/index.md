Jellycat is a British soft toy company founded in London in 1999 by brothers Thomas and William Gatacre. The brand produces plush toys across several product lines, including classic animals (Bashful Bunny, Bartholomew Bear) and the Amuseables collection featuring anthropomorphized everyday objects like foods and plants. The company expanded to Minneapolis in 2001 and maintains its own manufacturing facilities.

## What It Is

Jellycat plush toys are constructed primarily from polyester fabric in various textures including plush, velour, and velveteen. The filling consists of polyester fibers, sometimes combined with polyurethane beans for weight and flexibility. Most toys feature embroidered facial features rather than plastic eyes, allowing many products to be labeled suitable from birth.

The product range spans multiple size categories: mini, small (approximately 7 inches), medium (approximately 12 inches), large, huge (approximately 20 inches), and "really big." The Bashful Bunny line, one of the original and most recognized designs, features long floppy ears, a seated posture, and comes in numerous color variations including beige, cream, grey, and various pastels. The Amuseables collection depicts inanimate objects—vegetables, fruits, houseplants, baked goods—with simple embroidered faces and fabric legs.

All products undergo testing to international safety standards including EN71 (European) and ASTM (American). The toys are machine washable on a gentle cold cycle and air dry.

## How Kids Play

Children use Jellycat toys primarily as comfort objects and companions for imaginative play. The soft, squeezable construction makes them suitable for carrying, holding during sleep, and general cuddling. The floppy limbs and poseable nature of many designs allow children to position the toys for pretend scenarios.

With the Amuseables line, children incorporate the food and object characters into pretend play involving kitchens, gardens, and everyday scenarios. The seated posture of many Jellycat designs means they can be propped up on surfaces during play or displayed on shelves.

Older children and adults collect Jellycat toys, particularly limited editions and retired designs. The range of sizes allows the same character to serve different purposes—smaller versions for travel, larger versions for room decoration or more substantial cuddling.

## Notes

The company releases new designs regularly and retires others, creating a collector market for discontinued styles. Jellycat celebrated its 25th anniversary in February 2024 with an event at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston.

The brand is investigating increased use of recycled polyester while maintaining safety and quality standards. Products are handmade in company-owned factories and certified free from harmful chemicals according to company statements.

Size measurements can be counterintuitive: Jellycat measures from head to heel for standing-style toys, and provides separate "sitting height" measurements for seated designs like Bashful Bunny. The stated size on packaging reflects total length, not how tall the toy appears when sitting.

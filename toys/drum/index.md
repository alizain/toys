A drum is a percussion instrument that produces sound when struck with hands or mallets. Children's toy drums range from simple single-head drums to multi-piece drum sets scaled down for small bodies. They are among the earliest musical instruments introduced to young children due to their intuitive, cause-and-effect nature.

## What It Is

Children's drums come in several distinct forms. Single drums include hand drums, floor drums, bongos (paired drums of different sizes, typically 4-6 inches in diameter), and djembes (goblet-shaped drums often 10-24 inches tall). These are typically made from wood, plastic, or synthetic materials with drum heads made of animal skin, synthetic membranes, or rubber.

Drum sets for children are scaled-down versions of adult kits, usually consisting of a bass drum with foot pedal, two to five tom drums of varying sizes, one or more cymbals, a pair of drumsticks, and often a small stool. Materials range from durable plastic with chrome-style accents to sustainably sourced wood. Notable brands producing wooden sets include PlanToys, while VTech and B. toys offer electronic versions.

Electronic toy drums use rubber or mesh pads connected to a sound module that produces drum sounds through built-in speakers or headphones. These often include volume controls, multiple sound options (standard drums, animal sounds, silly noises, DJ effects), light-up features, and pre-recorded melodies in various styles such as rock, dance, and pop.

## How Kids Play

Infants and young toddlers typically strike single drums or surfaces with open palms or provided mallets, exploring the relationship between their actions and the resulting sounds. They experiment with force, speed, and striking different areas of the drum head to discover tonal variations.

With drum sets, children often sit on the included stool and use drumsticks to strike different drums and cymbals, exploring the range of sounds each component produces. The foot pedal for the bass drum introduces coordination between hands and feet. Children may play freely, creating their own rhythms, or follow along with music.

Electronic drums encourage structured play through features like follow-the-lights sequences that teach patterns, educational content incorporating letters and numbers, and play-along modes with built-in songs. Some children use the microphone attachments included with certain sets to sing while drumming.

Hand drums like bongos and djembes are often played while sitting on the floor, with children striking the drum head with fingers and palms. These drums allow multiple children to gather around a single instrument, taking turns or playing together.

## Notes

The physical requirements of drum play change significantly with age. Toddler drums prioritize lightweight construction, rounded edges, non-toxic materials, and drum heads that produce sound with minimal force. Junior drum sets for ages 5 and up begin to resemble actual instruments, with adjustable heights to accommodate growing bodies.

Volume is a notable consideration. Electronic drums with headphone jacks and volume controls address parental concerns about noise levels while allowing children to play freely. Acoustic toy drums vary considerably in volume output based on construction materials and drum head tension.

The transition from toy drums to beginner instruments is not always clearly defined. Some products marketed as toys, particularly wooden drum sets with quality construction, function as genuine entry-level instruments. Junior acoustic drum sets from brands like Pearl bridge the gap between toy and instrument, featuring real wood shells and proper drum hardware scaled for children under 10.

The Matchbox 4-Level Garage is a multi-story parking structure playset designed for 1:64 scale die-cast vehicles. Manufactured by Mattel and first released in 2015 under product code CJM67, it serves as both a play environment and storage solution for small toy cars. The set includes one Matchbox tow truck and does not require batteries.

## What It Is

The playset stands approximately 12 inches tall with four distinct levels connected by a spiral ramp. Each level features different play stations: a gas pump area, a car repair station, a car wash section with rotating brushes, and a crane. A manual elevator mechanism allows cars to travel between floors. The structure is made of molded plastic with printed details representing garage signage and equipment. The design accommodates standard Matchbox and similar 1:64 scale vehicles, though some oversized Matchbox models may not fit through all sections.

## How Kids Play

Children typically begin by loading cars onto the elevator platform and cranking or pushing them up to higher levels. From the top, cars roll down the spiral ramp, gaining speed as they descend through multiple turns. The gas pump and repair stations become stopping points where children park vehicles and engage in pretend maintenance scenarios. The car wash section has parts that move against the cars as they pass through. The included tow truck often serves a role in retrieving cars or transporting them between play areas. Children frequently incorporate the garage into larger scenarios with roadways, other buildings, or additional vehicles from their collections.

## Notes

The elevator is entirely kid-powered with no motorized components. This means the play experience depends on manual operation rather than automated features. Some users report that the plastic construction holds up to regular play without the ramp sections separating, which has been a point of failure in similar products. The set can connect to other Matchbox playsets, allowing for expanded layouts. Only one vehicle is included, so the garage functions more fully when children already own additional die-cast cars.

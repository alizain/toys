The Osmo Genius Starter Kit is a tablet-based educational system that combines physical game pieces with on-screen activities. Players interact with tangible objects placed in front of an iPad or Fire tablet, which the device recognizes through a camera and reflector system. The kit includes five games focused on math, spelling, spatial reasoning, physics concepts, and drawing.

## What It Is

The kit consists of an Osmo Base (a stand that holds the tablet at an angle), a red reflector that clips over the tablet's camera, and three stackable storage containers holding the game pieces. The physical components include seven colorful geometric tangram pieces, 40 number tiles (a mix of digit tiles showing 0-9 and dot tiles for counting), and 52 letter tiles split between red and blue sets with uppercase and lowercase letters.

The reflector redirects the tablet's front-facing camera to view the play area in front of the device. When players place physical pieces on the table surface, the system recognizes their position and orientation in real time. No WiFi connection is required during gameplay once the apps are downloaded.

## How Kids Play

Children sit in front of the tablet and manipulate physical pieces on the table surface while watching the screen for feedback.

In the Tangram game, players arrange the seven geometric shapes to match black silhouettes displayed on screen, which progress from simple shapes to more complex animals and objects. The Numbers game has players placing digit and dot tiles to solve arithmetic problems, with activities ranging from basic counting to addition and multiplication. Words works like a visual spelling game where players use letter tiles to identify pictures shown on screen, guessing letters one at a time.

Newton involves no special pieces; players draw lines on paper or use physical objects in front of the camera to redirect bouncing balls toward targets on screen. Masterpiece displays outlines on screen that players trace with pencil on paper, with options to generate outlines from photographs.

Multiple children can participate together, taking turns placing pieces or collaborating on puzzle solutions.

## Notes

The recognition system works consistently, identifying pieces even when placed at various angles. The tangram game tends to hold attention for extended periods, particularly among children working together to solve more complex shapes. The stackable storage containers keep the small pieces organized but require some care to keep letter tiles from mixing between the red and blue sets. The base fits most iPad models but requires a separate reflector accessory for certain newer iPad Pro and iPad Air models.

The infinity cube is a handheld fidget toy consisting of eight small cubes connected by hinges, allowing continuous folding in multiple directions. The design originates from the Yoshimoto Cube, a geometric puzzle created by Japanese designer Naoki Yoshimoto in 1970. The toy gained widespread popularity during the mid-2010s fidget toy trend.

## What It Is

An infinity cube measures approximately 1.5 inches per side in its folded form, with eight identical unit cubes arranged in a 2x2x2 configuration. The cubes connect via 12 hinges—typically metal pins, rivets, or plastic joints—that allow 90-degree rotations along shared edges. Standard consumer versions use ABS plastic blocks with stainless steel rivets, while premium models feature machined aluminum or brass construction. Some versions include translucent plastic blocks with visible silver bearings at each hinge point. The structure can fold inward repeatedly without returning to its starting position for several cycles; mathematically, it has exactly six distinct configurations before repeating.

## How Kids Play

Children fold and flip the cube while engaged in other activities—during homework, while waiting, or when listening to instructions. The toy operates quietly, making it usable in classroom settings. Users hold it lightly with one or two hands and rotate sections in various directions, producing a continuous folding motion. Some children work through all six configurations systematically, while others fold it absently in a repetitive pattern. The cube can be manipulated with one hand once the user becomes familiar with the motion. Children sometimes attempt to fold it as quickly as possible or challenge others to match specific configurations.

## Notes

The infinity cube produces a soft clicking sound with each fold, quieter than many other fidget toys. Unlike puzzles with a solved state, there is no goal or endpoint—the folding continues indefinitely. The hinges on budget plastic versions may loosen with heavy use, causing the cube to feel less stable over time. Some users find the repetitive folding motion calming, while others lose interest once the novelty of the mechanism fades. The toy fits easily in a pocket. Paper and cardboard DIY versions exist as craft projects, though they lack the durability of manufactured versions.

Playmobil Castle and Knights sets are modular medieval playsets manufactured by the German company Playmobil (geobra Brandstatter). The Knights theme has been part of the Playmobil line since the company's founding in 1974, making it one of their original product categories. Current iterations appear under the Novelmore line, while classic sets feature factions such as Lion Knights, Hawk Knights, Wolf Knights, and Falcon Knights.

## What It Is

A typical castle set consists of a multi-towered plastic fortress structure with walls, gates, and interior rooms. Assembled castles range from approximately 48-56 cm in length and 34-88 cm in height depending on the set. The structures feature working mechanical elements: drawbridges operated by cranks that raise and lower, portcullises that drop, trapdoors that open to dungeons below, and in some sets, breakaway wall sections designed to simulate siege damage.

Sets include 2.9-inch (7.5 cm) articulated figures with the distinctive rounded Playmobil head shape. The figures bend at the waist, have movable arms, and rotating heads. Castle sets typically include 3-4 knight figures equipped with removable armor, helmets, swords, shields, spears, and axes. Horses with saddles and armor are common inclusions. Accessories vary by set but often include catapults or crossbows with projectiles, thrones, banners, and coat-of-arms shields denoting the knight faction.

The construction uses interlocking plastic wall sections and platforms. Larger sets such as the Royal Lion Knight's Castle (6000) or Grand Castle of Novelmore (70220) contain over 100 individual pieces. The plastic construction has proven durable, with secondhand sets often remaining intact across multiple owners.

## How Kids Play

Children position knight figures in defensive positions on towers and walls, operating the drawbridge mechanism to control access. The catapults and crossbows shoot small projectiles at opposing figures or walls. Sets with breakaway wall sections allow children to knock down portions during siege scenarios and rebuild them afterward.

Play typically involves two opposing forces: attackers attempting to breach the castle and defenders holding their position. Children narrate battles, prisoner rescues from the dungeon via the trapdoor, and horseback pursuits outside the walls. The figures move between rooms and platforms, climb ladders attached to walls, and occupy the throne room.

Some children incorporate the castle into broader scenarios with other Playmobil themes or non-Playmobil figures. The modular wall system allows reconfiguration and combination with castle expansion sets (additional towers, siege equipment, training grounds). Dragon figures, when included or purchased separately, add a fantasy element to otherwise historical play.

Sessions often extend to an hour or more as children construct multi-part narratives. The figures' articulation and removable accessories support detailed manipulation during dramatic moments.

## Notes

The small removable accessories (swords, helmets, arrows) scatter during play and require collection during cleanup. Parents often store small parts in labeled containers to prevent loss.

Playmobil markets some castle lines to boys (knight factions with battle themes) and others to girls (princess castles with domestic interiors), though in practice children play with either regardless of marketing.

The interlock construction means assembled castles occupy substantial shelf or floor space. Some families keep the castle permanently assembled; others disassemble for storage, which requires time to rebuild before each session.

Older discontinued sets appear frequently in secondhand markets. The durable plastic construction means vintage sets from the 1990s and 2000s often remain playable, though finding complete accessory inventories proves difficult.

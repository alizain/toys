# Session Summary: ac36fd32-73f1-4697-8f32-7c5ce880ed84

## Session ID
`ac36fd32-73f1-4697-8f32-7c5ce880ed84`

## Date/Timestamp
**Started**: 2025-12-25T17:17:48.220Z (December 25, 2025, approximately 5:17 PM UTC)

**Duration**: Approximately 1 minute before user interruption

## Main Topic
**Subagent orchestration for toy image collection**

The user requested the assistant to act as an orchestrator that would spawn and manage subagents. Each subagent would be responsible for finding and downloading 3-7 high-quality, high-resolution images for individual toys located in `packages/toys/toys/`. The images would be saved with descriptive filenames and added to each toy's `index.md` file.

## What was tried
1. The assistant began analyzing the task and identified approximately 200 toys to process
2. The assistant decided to start with the first toy: `anki-overdrive`
3. A `Task` tool call was initiated to spawn a subagent for the Anki Overdrive toy with detailed instructions:
   - Check if images already exist (quit early if 3+ exist)
   - Search for high quality product images
   - Download 3-7 images with descriptive filenames
   - Update the `index.md` file with markdown image syntax
   - Focus on official product photos, track setups, AI cars, kids playing, and packaging

## What was found/learned
The session did not progress far enough to discover any findings. The assistant acknowledged the scale of the task (approximately 200 toys) and planned a sequential, one-at-a-time subagent spawning approach as requested.

## What was accomplished
Nothing concrete was accomplished. The session was interrupted by the user immediately after the first subagent task was initiated but before it could execute. The interruption came with the message `[Request interrupted by user for tool use]`.

## Key quotes or thoughts
The user's original request contained important design constraints:
- "one subagent per toy"
- "go slowly, don't spawn more than 1 subagent at a time"
- "if the toy already has enough images, it should quit and end work early"

The assistant's planned approach for image sourcing:
- Official product photos
- The race track setup
- The AI-powered cars
- Kids playing with it
- Box/packaging shots

## Open questions
- Why was the session interrupted? Was the user testing the approach before committing to a long-running operation?
- Is there a related session where this work was continued or retried?
- Are there rate limiting concerns with image downloading that motivated the "go slowly" instruction?
- What image hosting/storage approach was intended for the downloaded images?

## Session Status
**Incomplete/Aborted** - The session was interrupted by the user during the first subagent spawn attempt, before any images could be searched for or downloaded.

## Related Sessions
This appears to be a sibling or predecessor to session `1b90b2bc-7e69-4265-88bc-1b6803c1a9b3` which has an almost identical request, also interrupted immediately (started at 17:18:52Z, about 1 minute after this session).

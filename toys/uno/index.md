UNO is a shedding-type card game where players take turns matching cards by color or number, with the goal of being the first to empty their hand. Created in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, and now owned by Mattel, it has become one of the most widely recognized card games in the world.

## What It Is

A standard UNO deck contains 108 cards divided among four color suits: red, yellow, green, and blue. Each suit includes one zero card, two each of numbers 1 through 9, and two each of three action cards (Skip, Draw Two, and Reverse). The deck also contains four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards. Decks manufactured since 2018 include 112 cards, adding a Wild Shuffle Hands card and three blank customizable Wild cards.

The cards are typically made of coated cardstock paper with a glossy finish. An eco-friendly "Nothin' But Paper" edition uses Forest Stewardship Council certified materials, soy-based ink, and water-based glue. Premium plastic editions exist for increased durability and water resistance.

Cards measure approximately standard playing card size. The deck comes packaged in a cardboard box or sometimes a tin container. Each card displays its number or symbol prominently in the center with the corresponding color background, along with smaller corner indicators.

## How Kids Play

UNO supports 2 to 10 players. Each player receives seven cards dealt face-down. Players take turns playing a card that matches the discard pile's top card by either color, number, or symbol. When a player cannot match, they draw from the draw pile. When a player has one card remaining, they must call out "UNO" or face a penalty of drawing four additional cards if caught.

Action cards add strategic elements: Skip cards force the next player to lose their turn, Reverse cards change the direction of play, and Draw Two cards make the next player draw cards and skip their turn. Wild cards allow the player to choose any color, and Wild Draw Four cards combine this with forcing the next player to draw four cards.

Younger children often learn color and number matching first, sometimes with simplified house rules that remove action cards. The UNO Junior version, designed for ages 3 and up, features animal illustrations on each number card and three progressive difficulty levels. Children around age 4-5 can often play standard UNO with some assistance. By age 7, most children handle the full ruleset independently.

The game is inherently social, requiring turn-taking and awareness of other players' card counts. Games typically last 10-30 minutes depending on player count. Players frequently develop their own house rules and variations.

## Notes

The requirement to announce "UNO" when holding one card creates a distinctive social dynamic where players watch each other closely and call out forgotten announcements. This self-policing aspect generates much of the game's interpersonal tension.

Merle Robbins initially developed UNO after a disagreement with his son about Crazy Eights rules. He mortgaged his home to produce 5,000 copies and sold them from his barbershop before eventually selling the rights for $50,000 plus royalties.

The game is commonly used in educational and therapeutic settings. Teachers use it for indoor recess and free time. Therapists employ it to help children practice frustration tolerance, turn-taking, and good sportsmanship in a structured but engaging context.

Standard scoring awards points based on cards remaining in opponents' hands when one player goes out. The official winning score is 500 points accumulated across multiple rounds, though many casual players simply play single rounds without keeping score.

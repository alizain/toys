The Frisbee is a circular flying disc toy that players throw through the air to one another. Originating from the informal practice of tossing pie tins at New England colleges in the late 19th century, the modern plastic version was developed in the late 1940s and commercially produced by Wham-O beginning in 1957. The toy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1998.

## What It Is

A Frisbee is a disc-shaped object typically measuring 20 to 25 centimeters (8 to 10 inches) in diameter. The disc features a pronounced raised lip around its edge and a slightly concave underside. Its cross-section forms an airfoil shape, with what designer Walter Morrison called the "Morrison slope" along the edge, which generates lift during flight. Most discs are made from injection-molded plastic and weigh between 60 and 175 grams depending on the intended use. The surface often includes raised concentric ridges, a design element added by engineer Ed Headrick in 1967 to stabilize the disc's flight path.

## How Kids Play

Children throw the disc back and forth with a flicking motion of the wrist, releasing it at an angle that allows it to glide through the air. The spinning motion created by the throw provides gyroscopic stability, enabling the disc to travel in a relatively straight path. Players catch the disc with one or both hands. Young children often begin with lightweight foam or fabric versions before progressing to standard plastic discs. Common play patterns include simple catch between two or more people, throwing for distance, and target games where players aim at specific objects or areas. Older children sometimes engage in organized games such as Ultimate, a team sport played on a field with end zones.

## Notes

The name "Frisbee" derives from the Frisbie Pie Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut, whose empty pie tins college students threw recreationally while calling out "Frisbie!" to warn passersby. Wham-O altered the spelling when trademarking the name in 1958. The disc's flight relies on the same aerodynamic principles as aircraft wings: the spinning motion and airfoil shape reduce drag while generating lift. Dogs have become closely associated with Frisbee play, and canine disc competitions exist as a distinct activity. The World Flying Disc Federation governs international competition in disc sports including Ultimate, disc golf, and freestyle events.

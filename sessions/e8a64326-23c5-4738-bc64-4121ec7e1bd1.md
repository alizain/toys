# Session Summary: Massive Pairwise Toy Rating Session (social_affordance, sensory_experience, developmental_longevity)

**Session ID**: e8a64326-23c5-4738-bc64-4121ec7e1bd1

**Date/Timestamp**: December 26-27, 2025 (started 22:17 UTC on Dec 26, ended 01:12 UTC on Dec 27)

**Main Topic**: Completing pairwise toy comparisons for multiple rating dimensions using the prepare-dimension.ts and save-vote.ts scripts. This was a marathon rating session covering three dimensions.

## What Was Tried

1. **Initial Subagent Approach**
   - User first attempted to spawn subagents to rate the `social_affordance` dimension
   - The subagent approach was interrupted and abandoned after the first attempt
   - Switched to direct execution within the main session

2. **Direct Rating Workflow**
   - Used `npx tsx packages/toys/scripts/prepare-dimension.ts --dimension <dimension>` to get batches of toy pairs
   - Evaluated each pair using the dimension's criteria (question, keyQuestions, scoringGuide)
   - Saved votes using `npx tsx packages/toys/scripts/save-vote.ts <dimension> <toyA> <toyB> <winner|tie>`
   - Processed batches of 40 pairs at a time, running 10 save-vote commands in parallel for speed

3. **Dimensions Covered**
   - `social_affordance`: How well toys support collaborative play, turn-taking, and social interaction
   - `sensory_experience`: Tactile, auditory, visual engagement qualities
   - `developmental_longevity`: How long a toy remains engaging as the child grows

## What Was Found/Learned

- The prepare-dimension.ts script includes connectivity analysis to ensure the comparison graph remains well-connected (tracking articulation points, component count, zero-connection toys)
- The script outputs structured JSON with pairs, toy content, and batch statistics
- Each batch contained exactly 40 pairs to process
- The session completed approximately 45+ batches across multiple dimensions (1800+ comparisons)
- Voting rationale was tracked in command descriptions (e.g., "Vote: basketball wins (team sport)", "Vote: tie (both collaborative)")

---

## What Was Accomplished

- **social_affordance dimension**: Completed all comparisons
  - Examples: basketball-hoop beat candy-land (active team sport), catan-junior beat chess-for-kids (negotiation element), dollhouse beat crayons (collaborative pretend), zingo beat xylophone

- **sensory_experience dimension**: Completed all comparisons
  - Started after social_affordance was complete

- **developmental_longevity dimension**: Partially completed (interrupted at batch 46)
  - Comparisons like: connect-four beat anki-overdrive, checkers beat aquadoodle-mat, cuisenaire-rods beat aquadoodle-mat
  - Session was interrupted by user during batch 46

## Key Quotes or Thoughts

The session demonstrated a methodical approach to pairwise ranking:
- For social_affordance: "Vote: catan wins (negotiation element)", "Vote: climbing-dome wins (simultaneous play)", "Vote: doctor kit wins (social roleplay)"
- Brief thinking notes: "20/40 done for batch 2. Next 10.", "Batch 45 complete. Let me continue with Batch 46"
- The agent assigned mental scores (1-10) based on the scoring guide before comparing pairs

---

## Open Questions

- The developmental_longevity dimension was interrupted mid-batch (batch 46) - remaining comparisons need to be completed
- No final summary or statistics were generated showing total votes recorded
- The session was interrupted by user at 01:12 UTC - unclear if this was intentional or accidental
- No verification that all saved votes were properly persisted to the votes storage

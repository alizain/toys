A tangram is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat geometric pieces, called tans, that originated in China around the late 18th century. The puzzle spread to Europe and America via trading ships in the early 1800s and remains one of the most widely recognized geometric puzzles.

## What It Is

A tangram set contains exactly seven pieces cut from a square: two large right isosceles triangles, one medium right isosceles triangle, two small right isosceles triangles, one square, and one parallelogram. When assembled correctly, all seven pieces form a square with no gaps or overlaps. The parallelogram is the only piece lacking reflection symmetry, meaning it must be flipped over to form certain configurations. Traditional sets are made from wood with smooth, sanded surfaces, though modern versions also come in plastic or cardboard. Each piece is typically painted in solid colors.

## How Kids Play

Children arrange all seven pieces flat on a surface to recreate shapes shown on pattern cards or silhouettes. The basic rules require that all pieces touch, none overlap, and all seven are used in every figure. Simpler puzzles show internal lines indicating where each piece goes, while classic silhouette puzzles show only the outline, requiring the player to determine piece placement. Children commonly form animal shapes (cats, rabbits, birds), human figures, geometric forms, letters, and numbers. A single tangram set can produce over 6,500 documented configurations. Some children work from puzzle books or cards, while others create original designs.

## Notes

The parallelogram piece often causes initial confusion because it requires flipping, unlike the other six pieces which only need rotation. Mathematicians proved in 1942 that only thirteen convex shapes can be formed with a tangram. The puzzle is frequently used in classrooms for geometry instruction. Younger children typically need pattern cards with visible internal lines before progressing to silhouette-only challenges.

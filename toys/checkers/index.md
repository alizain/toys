Checkers is a two-player strategy board game played on a square board with alternating light and dark squares. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally, attempting to capture opponent pieces by jumping over them. The game is also widely known as draughts, particularly in British English.

## What It Is

A standard checkers set consists of a game board and 24 round, flat playing pieces (12 per player) in two contrasting colors, typically red and black or white and black. The board is an 8x8 grid of 64 alternating squares, with gameplay occurring only on the dark squares.

The pieces are disc-shaped, designed to stack on top of one another when a piece is "kinged" upon reaching the opposite end of the board. Sets come in various materials including wood, plastic, cardboard, and composite materials. Wooden sets often feature solid maple or walnut boards with turned wooden pieces, while travel and children's sets commonly use plastic pieces that may interlock for storage. Giant outdoor versions feature pieces ranging from 2 inches up to 14 inches in diameter, made from materials like teak, rubberwood, or fiberglass.

Many sets combine checkers with chess, using a reversible or double-sided board. Folding boards with interior storage compartments are common for portability.

## How Kids Play

Players sit on opposite sides of the board, each arranging their 12 pieces on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them. The player with the darker colored pieces moves first.

On each turn, a player moves one piece diagonally forward to an adjacent empty dark square. When an opponent's piece occupies an adjacent diagonal square with an empty square beyond it, the player must jump over and capture that piece, removing it from the board. Multiple jumps in a single turn are possible and required when available.

When a piece reaches the far end of the board (the opponent's back row), it becomes a "king" by having a second piece stacked on top of it. Kings gain the ability to move and capture in both forward and backward directions.

The game ends when one player captures all opponent pieces or blocks them from making any legal move.

Children around age 5 can begin learning the basic rules, though full strategic understanding develops over time. Younger children may initially focus on the jumping mechanics before grasping defensive positioning and multi-move planning. The game is inherently social, requiring two players, though some children play both sides to practice. Parents and older siblings often serve as initial opponents, sometimes allowing young players to take back moves while learning.

## Notes

Checkers has ancient roots, with game boards resembling modern checkers found in archaeological sites dating to around 1400 BCE in the Middle East. The current form emerged in 12th century Europe when the game was adapted to use a chessboard.

Several regional variations exist beyond the standard American/English version. International draughts uses a 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player and features "flying kings" that can move multiple squares diagonally. Canadian checkers uses a 12x12 board. Russian, Turkish, and Armenian variants each have distinct rules about piece movement and capture requirements.

Chinese checkers, despite its name, is an unrelated game invented in Germany in 1892. It uses a star-shaped board with marbles or pegs and involves racing pieces to the opposite side rather than capturing opponents.

The game has been mathematically solved. In 2007, researchers at the University of Alberta proved that perfect play by both sides results in a draw. This makes checkers the most complex game ever solved, though the strategic depth remains engaging for human players at all levels.

Many educators recommend checkers as a precursor to chess. The simpler ruleset allows children to focus on concepts like planning ahead, considering opponent responses, and controlling board space without the complexity of multiple piece types.

**Main Topic**: Filter /rate page by version key in frontmatter

## Summary
This session's conversation was compacted to a single summary: "Filter /rate page by version key in frontmatter". This indicates work was done to modify the `/rate` page to only show toys that have a `version` key in their frontmatter (indicating they are ready/finalized toys).

The session then contained a `/usage` command.

## What was accomplished
Filtered the rating harness to only display versioned toys.

## Connection to other sessions
This relates to session 2bc878d7 where the rating scripts were also updated to filter by version key.

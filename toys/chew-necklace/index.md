A chew necklace is a wearable sensory tool designed to provide a safe outlet for chewing. It consists of a pendant made from food-grade silicone attached to a cord that hangs around the neck. These items are commonly used by children with sensory processing needs, autism, ADHD, or anxiety, as well as by neurotypical children who have a tendency to chew on non-food items.

## What It Is

A chew necklace typically features a silicone pendant in various shapes suspended from a nylon cord. Common pendant shapes include geometric forms (rectangles, diamonds, tubes), animal designs (sharks, dinosaurs, dragons), food shapes (donuts), and abstract patterns. The silicone material is soft enough not to damage teeth and gums while being durable enough to withstand repeated chewing.

Most chew necklaces come in multiple toughness levels to accommodate different chewing intensities. ARK Therapeutic, a major manufacturer, offers three color-coded toughness levels. Munchables categorizes their products as "light, medium, and strong chew." Some brands offer a "Mega" version with twice the thickness for more intense sensory feedback and greater durability.

The cords typically feature a breakaway clasp as a safety mechanism, designed to release if the necklace gets caught on something. However, not all brands include this feature. The pendants themselves may have smooth surfaces, textured bumps, ridges, or knobs to provide varied sensory input to the mouth, lips, and tongue.

Beyond necklaces, related products include chewable bracelets, pencil toppers, and zipper pulls for those who prefer not to wear jewelry around the neck.

## How Kids Play

Children wear the necklace and bring the pendant to their mouth to chew when they feel the need. This is not play in the traditional sense but rather a self-regulation tool. The chewing action provides oral sensory input that can help some children feel calmer, more focused, and more in control.

Children often use chew necklaces during activities that require concentration, such as schoolwork or homework. The tactile and proprioceptive feedback from chewing may help redirect nervous energy. Teachers and parents frequently introduce these tools as an alternative to chewing on fingers, pencils, shirt collars, crayons, erasers, or hair.

Use is typically individual rather than social. A child might chew intermittently throughout the day or during specific high-stress moments. The wearable format means the tool is always accessible without needing to be retrieved from a bag or pocket.

Age ranges vary by product and manufacturer. Most are recommended for ages 3 and up due to choking hazard concerns with younger children. Some products are designed specifically for teens and adults, featuring more subtle or mature designs that are less visually obvious as sensory tools.

## Notes

The term "chewelry" (a portmanteau of "chew" and "jewelry") is widely used to describe this category of products. Several established brands exist in this space, including ARK Therapeutic (based in South Carolina), Munchables (Canada), and Chewigem (UK).

These products are explicitly designed with safety in mind. Materials are FDA-approved, BPA-free, phthalate-free, and free of lead and other harmful metals. Manufacturers recommend regular inspection for signs of wear, chipping, or cracking, and advise discarding damaged items. The silicone will eventually degrade with use, particularly for aggressive chewers.

The different toughness levels serve a practical purpose: softer options are gentler for light chewers, while tougher options last longer for those who chew more intensely. However, even the most durable versions are not indestructible and are not recommended for extremely aggressive chewing.

Adult supervision is generally recommended, particularly for younger children or new users. Some products advise against wearing during outdoor play or situations where the necklace could snag on equipment.

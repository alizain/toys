The Rubik's Cube is a three-dimensional combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, it was renamed and released internationally in 1980. The puzzle has sold over 500 million units worldwide since its commercial debut.

## What It Is

A standard Rubik's Cube measures 57mm (approximately 5.7 cm or 2.25 inches) on each side. The cube appears to consist of 26 smaller cubes, called cubies, arranged in a 3x3x3 configuration around a central pivot mechanism. Each of the six faces displays nine colored squares in one of six colors: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow.

The internal mechanism uses a rounded core that allows each of the cube's six faces to rotate independently while the structure remains intact. The cubies interlock with this central axis rather than connecting to each other directly. Modern versions use colored ABS plastic pieces instead of the original adhesive stickers, which prevents peeling and color fading over time.

## How Kids Play

Children typically begin by turning the faces randomly, scrambling the colors across all six sides. The primary play pattern involves attempting to restore each face to a single solid color. Some children work on solving one face at a time, while others focus on positioning specific pieces.

Many children learn solving methods through tutorial videos or written guides, which break the solution into stages with specific move sequences called algorithms. Repeated practice develops muscle memory for these sequences. Some children time their solves with a stopwatch and work to reduce their solving time. Others enjoy scrambling the cube for friends or family members to solve.

Younger children sometimes use the cube for color-matching activities without attempting a full solution, or practice turning the faces to develop manual dexterity.

## Notes

The cube has 43 quintillion possible arrangements, but any scrambled state can be solved in 20 moves or fewer. This mathematical property was proven in 2010 and is sometimes called "God's number."

The first World Championship was held in Budapest in 1982, with a winning time of 22.95 seconds. Current world records are under 4 seconds. Competitive solving, called speedcubing, has developed into an organized activity with standardized timing equipment and competition formats.

Simplified 2x2 versions exist for younger children, and larger variants (4x4, 5x5, and beyond) offer increased complexity for experienced solvers.

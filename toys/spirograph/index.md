Spirograph is a geometric drawing toy that uses interlocking plastic gears to create curved, repeating patterns on paper. Developed by British engineer Denys Fisher in the early 1960s and introduced to the American market by Kenner in 1966, the toy produces mathematical curves known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. Earlier gear-based drawing devices existed from the late 1800s, but the Spirograph became the definitive consumer version of this concept.

## What It Is

The standard Spirograph set contains a collection of toothed plastic wheels, rings, and bars in various sizes. The larger pieces serve as stators (stationary frames) and include both circular rings and straight bars with gear teeth along their edges. The smaller wheels, called rotors, have multiple small holes positioned at different distances from their centers. Pins or removable putty secure the stator to paper, and a ballpoint pen inserted through one of the rotor's holes traces the design as the smaller gear moves along the larger one.

## How Kids Play

The child selects a stator (typically a large ring) and pins or presses it to a sheet of paper. They then choose a smaller wheel, place it inside or against the stator with teeth engaged, and insert a pen through one of the holes. Pushing the pen while keeping the teeth meshed causes the small wheel to rotate around the stator's circumference. As the wheel completes multiple rotations, the pen traces overlapping curves that form symmetrical patterns. Changing the wheel size, hole position, or pen color produces different designs. The process requires steady pressure to keep the teeth engaged and the pen in contact with the paper. Some children trace complete patterns in one color, while others switch colors partway through to create multicolored designs.

## Notes

The standard version is marketed for ages 8 and up, though a junior version with larger pieces exists for children as young as 3. Adult assistance often helps younger children who may struggle to maintain consistent pressure on the gears. Modern versions use removable putty instead of pins to secure the stators, reducing the risk of pin pricks and paper damage. The mathematical patterns the toy produces have been used historically in contexts ranging from banknote security features to decorative arts.

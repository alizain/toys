Dominoes are rectangular tiles divided by a line into two square ends, each marked with a number of spots (called pips or dots) or left blank. They function both as game pieces for matching games and as standalone building toys for stacking and toppling. The traditional double-six set contains 28 unique tiles representing all combinations of zero to six pips on each end.

## What It Is

A standard domino tile measures approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, with thickness varying by material. The face is divided into two halves by a center line, and each half displays a pattern of pips arranged like those on six-sided dice. The backs are typically plain or decorated with a uniform pattern.

Children's dominoes come in several materials. Wooden sets often use beech or other hardwoods with painted or printed pip patterns, finished with child-safe paints. Plastic dominoes are commonly made from ABS plastic, which provides durability and consistent weight. Cardboard and cardstock versions exist for younger children or disposable use.

The double-six set (28 tiles) is most common for children, though extended sets exist: double-nine (55 tiles), double-twelve (91 tiles), and larger. Some children's sets replace traditional pip patterns with colors, pictures, or numbers to support different types of matching play.

Specialized "bulk dominoes" designed purely for toppling come in sets of 100 to 200 or more identical tiles, often in multiple colors. These are typically lighter and have squared edges optimized for standing upright and falling consistently.

## How Kids Play

Children engage with dominoes in two distinct ways: as a matching game and as a construction toy.

**Matching games**: Players take turns placing tiles end-to-end, matching the pip count on adjacent halves. In a basic blocking game, players draw a hand of tiles and take turns adding to the layout. When a player cannot match, they either draw from a reserve pile or pass. The first player to place all their tiles wins. Young children often play simplified versions, matching colors or pictures rather than counting pips.

**Toppling and chain reactions**: Children line up dominoes on end in rows, curves, or elaborate patterns, then knock over the first to trigger a chain reaction. This activity involves spacing tiles at consistent distances, planning paths, and building structures that incorporate ramps, bridges, or spiral formations. Children may spend considerable time setting up a run, then watch it fall in seconds. Some children rebuild the same pattern repeatedly; others continuously modify their designs.

**Stacking and building**: Dominoes serve as general construction blocks. Children stack them into towers, walls, and pyramids. The flat rectangular shape allows for various building techniques including overlapping layers, vertical stands, and balanced structures.

**Sorting and counting**: Younger children sort dominoes by pip count, total number of dots, or visual pattern. The tiles provide concrete objects for counting practice and one-to-one correspondence.

## Notes

Dominoes occupy an interesting position as both a game with formal rules and an open-ended construction material. Many children who own dominoes never learn the traditional matching games, using the tiles exclusively for toppling runs. The transformation from game piece to chain-reaction toy appears to have become dominant in how children encounter dominoes today.

The physical properties of dominoes create particular constraints. Tiles must be spaced close enough that one falling tile strikes the next, but not so close that setting one up disturbs its neighbors. This spacing requirement develops in children through trial and error. The frustration of accidentally triggering a partial collapse during setup is a common experience that teaches planning and fine motor control.

Double-six sets date to 18th century Europe, though domino games originated in China during the Song Dynasty (11th-12th century). The Western version differs from Chinese dominoes, which use 32 tiles, include duplicates, and have no blanks. Whether European dominoes evolved from Chinese predecessors or developed independently remains uncertain.

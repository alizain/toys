A tambourine is a handheld percussion instrument consisting of a circular frame with metal discs (jingles) mounted around its edge. Children's versions often include a drumhead stretched across one side, allowing for both shaking and tapping. The instrument produces sound through jingle vibration when moved or struck.

## What It Is

A children's tambourine typically measures 15-20 centimeters in diameter, smaller than adult versions. The circular frame holds 4-8 pairs of metal jingles (sometimes called zils) set into slots around the perimeter. Many children's models include a plastic or animal-skin drumhead on one side, creating a flat striking surface.

Frames are made from wood or molded plastic, often painted in primary colors. The jingles are chrome-plated metal discs that produce the characteristic rattling shimmer. Some models designed for infants omit the drumhead entirely, functioning purely as shakers. Wooden versions are frequently finished with non-toxic water-based paints. The frame may include finger holes or cutouts to help small hands maintain grip.

## How Kids Play

Children play tambourines through two primary methods: shaking and tapping. Shaking produces a continuous jingling sound, with intensity varying based on vigor of movement. Tapping the drumhead with the palm or fingers creates a percussive strike accompanied by a brief jingle accent.

In group settings, children pass tambourines around circles, sometimes following songs or games that prompt playing and pausing. Teachers use them for rhythm exercises where children attempt to match a beat or play along with music. Some children hold the tambourine in one hand and strike it against their opposite hip or thigh.

Young children often explore the instrument by tilting it at different angles to isolate individual jingles. They experiment with soft versus vigorous shaking and discover that rolling the tambourine in their hands produces a sustained shimmer effect. During free play, tambourines appear in marching games, dance activities, and pretend performances.

## Notes

The sound character differs between headless and headed tambourines. Models with a drumhead produce a defined percussive tone when struck, while open-frame versions emphasize the metallic jingle. Children's models generally produce a brighter, less resonant sound than professional instruments due to smaller jingle size and lighter frame construction.

The instrument requires no setup or tuning, which allows immediate play. Sound output is proportional to input—gentle movements produce quiet sounds, making it possible for children to regulate volume somewhat. However, tambourines are inherently loud instruments, and even moderate play produces noticeable sound.

Durability varies by construction. Plastic frames resist impact but may crack at jingle mounting points. Wooden frames are sturdier but heavier. The jingles themselves rarely fail, though they can bend if stepped on. Some children find the sustained jingle after each shake distracting when trying to produce discrete rhythmic patterns.

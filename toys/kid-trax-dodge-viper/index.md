The Kid Trax Dodge Viper SRT is a battery-powered ride-on vehicle designed as a scaled-down replica of the Dodge Viper sports car. It is a two-seater electric car that children can drive using a steering wheel and foot pedal, operating at speeds between 2.5 and 5 miles per hour.

## What It Is

This ride-on measures approximately 58 inches long, 23 inches wide, and 33 inches tall, weighing around 76 pounds. The body is made of molded plastic with a convertible sports car design that mirrors the Dodge Viper SRT styling. The vehicle features opening doors, side mirrors, and a cockpit with two seats.

The interior includes a steering wheel, a shift lever for selecting forward or reverse, and a foot pedal for acceleration. Dashboard controls include buttons for the LED headlights, a horn dial, and an FM radio with auxiliary MP3 input. A battery charge indicator displays remaining power.

The wheels have plastic rims with rubber traction strips (branded as Power Trax tires) designed to improve grip on smooth surfaces. The vehicle is powered by a 12-volt rechargeable battery that uses a direct-connect charging system. Available colors include blue with racing stripes, red, and pink.

The maximum combined rider weight capacity is 130 pounds.

## How Kids Play

Children drive this vehicle by sitting in the driver seat, pressing the foot pedal to accelerate, and steering with the wheel. The shift lever allows them to choose between two forward speeds and one reverse speed. Passengers can ride in the adjacent seat.

Driving typically takes place on driveways, sidewalks, patios, and flat lawn areas. The vehicle is not recommended for gravel, wet surfaces, or rough terrain. Children often drive in repeated circuits or patterns, stopping to use the horn or toggle the headlights.

The FM radio and MP3 input allow children to play music while driving. Some children incorporate the opening doors into arrival and departure routines. Play sessions depend on battery charge, which requires 8 to 24 hours to fully replenish.

At the younger end of the age range, children may need adult guidance to understand the controls and steering. Older children within the range typically operate independently after initial instruction.

## Notes

The vehicle's substantial weight (76 pounds) means it requires adult assistance for transport and storage. The size also means it takes up considerable garage or storage space.

The rubber traction strips on the otherwise plastic wheels represent a middle ground between pure plastic wheels (which can spin out on smooth concrete) and full rubber tires. They provide grip without the complexity of pneumatic tires.

Charging time is notable: a full charge can take up to 24 hours, which means daily use requires overnight charging discipline. The battery has a separate, shorter warranty period (6 months) compared to the vehicle itself (1 year).

The two-seater configuration creates social play opportunities, though the 130-pound combined weight limit means two larger children may exceed capacity. The driver position includes all controls; the passenger seat is for riding only.

Engine sounds are simulated electronically rather than produced by the motor itself.

A pound-tap bench is a tabletop wooden toy consisting of a frame with holes, colored pegs that fit through the holes, and a mallet. Children strike the pegs with the mallet, causing them to move through the bench. The toy has been a standard item in early childhood settings for decades.

## What It Is

The bench is a rectangular wooden frame, typically measuring around 10 inches long by 5 inches wide and tall. Eight to ten cylindrical pegs sit in holes drilled through the top surface. The pegs are sized so they cannot fall through completely and are often fixed in place. Each peg is painted a different color, and some versions add numbers, faces, or patterns. A short wooden mallet with a rounded head accompanies the bench. The overall construction uses solid wood with water-based, non-toxic paint finishes. Some versions, such as the Hape Pound & Tap Bench, include a xylophone element underneath where balls roll across tuned bars after being struck through the top.

## How Kids Play

Children grasp the mallet and swing it downward onto the pegs. When one peg is struck, it pushes through the bench and another peg rises on the opposite side. This up-and-down movement continues as long as the child keeps hammering. Toddlers often start by hitting pegs at random, then gradually aim for specific colors or try to establish a rhythm. Some children flip the bench over and repeat the process. With versions that include a xylophone, children may pull out the keyboard portion and strike it directly, or they pound balls through the top and listen to the tones produced as the balls roll across the bars. The mallet is sometimes used on surfaces other than the intended pegs.

## Notes

The pegs in most designs are permanently attached to prevent choking hazards and loss of pieces. The hammering motion requires grip strength and arm coordination that develops noticeably between ages one and three. Children often return to this toy repeatedly over months, and the activity tends to hold attention for varying lengths of time depending on the child. The sound of wood striking wood is distinct and can be loud in quiet spaces. Some benches show wear patterns on the peg tops after extended use.

The Strider 12 Sport is a pedal-free bicycle designed for young children to learn balance before transitioning to a pedal bike. The bike has no pedals, no chain, and no training wheels. Children propel themselves by pushing off the ground with their feet.

## What It Is

The Strider 12 Sport features a steel frame with a low step-through design and built-in footrests. The seat height adjusts from 28 to 43 cm (11 to 17 inches) and handlebar height adjusts from 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 inches), both using tool-free clamps. The bike weighs 3.0 kg (6.7 lbs) and supports riders up to 27 kg (60 lbs) with inseams between 31 and 46 cm (12 to 18 inches). It has 12-inch wheels with flat-free foam rubber tires that require no inflation or maintenance. The handlebars include small-diameter grips sized for young hands and a foam safety pad over the stem.

## How Kids Play

Children typically progress through several stages on a balance bike. Initially, many toddlers stand over the frame and walk the bike rather than sitting on the seat. This stage can last from a single session to several months, depending on the child's age and comfort level. Younger children tend to spend more time in this phase.

Once comfortable, children sit on the seat and stride by taking alternating steps while the bike supports their weight. They learn to keep the bike upright by feeling it lean side to side. With practice, children begin taking longer strides and lifting their feet briefly between steps.

In the final stage, children push off and glide with both feet raised, coasting on momentum. Some children use the built-in footrests during extended glides. At this point, children often navigate varied terrain including gentle slopes, paths, and trails.

## Notes

The bike arrives partially assembled and requires attaching the handlebars and seat. Both adjustments use quick-release clamps rather than tools. The foam tires are quieter on hard surfaces than air-filled tires and cannot go flat, though they provide less cushioning on rough ground. The steel frame adds durability but makes the Sport model heavier than the aluminum-framed Pro version (5.6 lbs). The low seat height minimum allows children as young as 18 months to touch the ground flat-footed if their inseam is at least 31 cm.

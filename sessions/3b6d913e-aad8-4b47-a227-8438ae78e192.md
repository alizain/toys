# Session Summary: 3b6d913e-aad8-4b47-a227-8438ae78e192

**Session ID**: 3b6d913e-aad8-4b47-a227-8438ae78e192
**Date/Timestamp**: December 26, 2025
**Main Topic**: Changing rating display from 70-scale to 100-scale

## What was tried

The user wanted to change how ratings are displayed - from "out of 70" to "out of 100" - as a display-only change without modifying underlying calculations.

## What was found/learned

An Explore agent thoroughly analyzed the codebase and identified all locations where ratings are displayed:

**Components showing "/ 70":**
1. `components/toy-card.tsx` (Line 65) - ScoreBadge component
2. `app/toys/[slug]/page.tsx` (Line 122) - Individual toy detail page

**Rating thresholds (used for color coding):**
- 56+ = Excellent (80%+ of 70)
- 49+ = Great (70%+ of 70)
- 42+ = Good (60%+ of 70)

**Legend/information text:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage footer and rating legend

**Filter options:**
- `components/filter-panel.tsx` - Filter dropdown with thresholds 35+, 42+, 49+, 56+, 63+

**Key insight**: The underlying data uses 7 dimensions × 10 points = 70 max total. To display as 100, multiply by 100/70 (~1.4286).

## What was accomplished

This session did the exploration and analysis phase. The actual changes required:
1. Scale displayed values by 100/70
2. Update text strings from "/ 70" to "/ 100"
3. Update threshold values proportionally (56→80, 49→70, 42→60)
4. Update legend text and filter options

## Key quotes or thoughts

> "Only change display, not underlying calculations"

The data layer (`lib/toys.ts` and `ratings.csv`) stores raw totals and should NOT change - transformation happens only at display time.

## Open questions

Session appears to have ended during the exploration phase - unclear if the actual code changes were implemented.

Code Master is a single-player logic puzzle game that uses physical tokens and map boards to teach programming-style sequential thinking. Players arrange action tokens on guide scrolls to navigate an avatar figure across illustrated maps, collecting crystals and reaching a portal destination.

## What It Is

The game consists of a spiral-bound map book containing 10 double-sided maps and a guide scroll book with 12 scrolls. Physical components include a plastic avatar figure and portal marker styled with blocky, pixelated shapes, 6 plastic crystals, 12 cardboard action tokens in green, red, and blue, and 8 cardboard conditional tokens. The instruction manual includes a solution guide for all 60 challenges. The entire game fits in a compact box roughly the size of a thick paperback book.

## How Kids Play

Players select a level from the instruction booklet, which specifies a map, guide scroll, and available tokens. They place the avatar, portal, and crystals on designated map positions, then arrange action tokens on the guide scroll to create a sequence of moves. Each colored token corresponds to a colored path on the map. The goal is to program a route that collects the required crystals and reaches the portal using exactly the tokens provided.

Early beginner levels use only action tokens for straightforward sequences. Intermediate and advanced levels introduce conditional tokens that create branching paths, functioning like "if-then" statements. For example, a conditional token might direct the avatar down one path if two crystals have been collected, and a different path otherwise. When a sequence fails, players rearrange their tokens and try again, a process analogous to debugging code.

Children typically work through puzzles individually, though multiple children sometimes collaborate on harder levels. Sessions often run 15-30 minutes as players complete several levels in sequence.

## Notes

The 60 levels are divided into four difficulty tiers: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. Progression is cumulative, with each level building on concepts from previous ones. Some children complete all levels in a few hours while others find intermediate levels challenging, indicating variable difficulty perception across players.

The game teaches flowchart-style sequential logic rather than actual programming syntax. Replay value is limited once all levels are solved, as each puzzle has a single correct solution. The oversized avatar and portal pieces can feel cramped on smaller map spaces. Solutions are visible in the instruction booklet, making it easy for children to peek if frustrated.

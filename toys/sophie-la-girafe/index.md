Sophie la Girafe is a rubber teething toy first manufactured in France in 1961. The toy was created by Monsieur Rampeau and named after Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat, whose feast day falls on May 25, the date of the toy's introduction. Production continues in France, currently by Vulli in Rumilly in the French Alps.

## What It Is

Sophie is a hollow rubber giraffe standing approximately 18 centimeters (7 inches) tall. The body is made from natural rubber derived from the sap of Hevea trees, with coloring applied using food-grade paints. The rubber has a soft, slightly textured surface and a distinct natural scent. The toy features dark brown spots across a cream-colored body, with a long neck, four legs, two horns, and two ears. A squeaker mechanism in the body produces a sound when the toy is compressed. Each Sophie is hand-painted, resulting in minor variations between individual toys.

## How Kids Play

Infants typically begin engaging with the toy around 3 months of age, coinciding with the developmental stage when babies discover their hands and begin mouthing objects. The toy's lightweight construction and elongated limbs allow young babies to grasp it before they develop a full palmar grip. Babies commonly chew on the ears, horns, and legs during teething. The squeaker produces an audible response when squeezed, which some infants learn to activate intentionally. Older babies pass the toy between hands and may drop and retrieve it repeatedly. Some toddlers continue to carry the toy as a comfort object after the teething period ends.

## Notes

The rubber has a noticeable smell that persists throughout the toy's use. The squeaker hole requires attention during cleaning to prevent water from entering the hollow interior. The food-grade paint may fade with extended chewing. The toy is marketed for single-child use. Over 70 million units have been sold since 1961, with annual sales in France exceeding the country's birth rate.

The Winkel is a teething and rattle toy manufactured by Manhattan Toy, a company founded in 1978. It consists of interconnected loops of soft plastic tubing joined at a central cube. The toy has been in production for over 25 years.

## What It Is

The Winkel measures approximately 5 inches wide, 4 inches deep, and 3.5 inches tall, weighing about 0.38 pounds. Its primary structure is a continuous maze of soft, pliable polyurethane tubes that form a roughly spherical shape with no beginning or end point. The tubes come in various color combinations, with blue, green, and orange being a common configuration. At the center sits a small plastic cube that houses a rattle mechanism. The tubing is BPA-free and does not contain PVC. The toy meets ASTM, EN71, CPSC, and CPSIA safety standards for infant products.

## How Kids Play

Infants grasp the tubes from various angles, as the open lattice design allows small hands to find purchase points easily. Babies mouth and chew on the soft tubes during teething. The lightweight construction allows even young infants (around 2-3 months) to hold and manipulate the toy independently. Shaking the toy activates the quiet rattle in the center cube. The interconnected loop design encourages passing the toy from hand to hand. Parents sometimes refrigerate the toy before giving it to teething babies; the manufacturer notes the tubes can be chilled for this purpose.

## Notes

The tubing is surface-wash only; the manufacturer advises against submerging, sterilizing, or microwaving the toy. The rattle sound is relatively quiet compared to many infant rattles. The design lacks small parts or detachable pieces. Manhattan Toy produces several themed variations of the Winkel design, including elephant and bee versions with additional features attached to the basic loop structure.

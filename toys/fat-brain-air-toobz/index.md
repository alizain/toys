Air Toobz is an air-powered tube construction system where children build pathways and watch foam balls travel through them. A rechargeable fan unit pushes air through connected transparent tubes, propelling lightweight balls through the network. The toy was designed by Fat Brain Toy Co. in Omaha, Nebraska and was a 2023 Toy of the Year Finalist.

## What It Is

The base set consists of a battery-powered fan unit that measures approximately 11.5 x 6.5 x 6 inches, along with modular tubing components. The tubes are transparent plastic, each 12 inches long, available in straight sections and curved corner pieces (the corner tubes are orange-tinted). A T-tube allows for branching paths. Connectors join the tube sections together without snaps or tabs. The set includes 20 EVA foam balls measuring 45mm in diameter and a silicone funnel for ball entry.

The fan unit contains a rechargeable battery with a dial to adjust airflow speed. It provides approximately one hour of runtime at full speed or three hours at half speed, with an auto shut-off feature after 15 minutes. The fan has a protective grate and will not operate while charging. Everything stores in a reusable carrying case.

## How Kids Play

Children arrange the tubes and connectors into configurations of their choosing, building networks that can loop, spiral, climb over furniture, or weave under tables. They place foam balls into the funnel or tube openings, switch on the fan, and observe the balls moving through the system. The adjustable airflow lets children experiment with how different speeds affect ball movement. Children can attempt to make balls jump between separate tube sections, hover in mid-air at tube exits, or circulate continuously through closed loops.

Play often involves iterative building, where children construct a path, test it, observe what happens, then modify the design. The transparent tubes allow children to watch the balls throughout their journey.

## Notes

Several expansion products exist for this system:

- **Expansion Pack**: Contains 12 additional tubes (6 straight, 6 corner), 12 connectors, and 10 foam balls, allowing for larger constructions
- **Whirlwind Accessory Pack**: Adds two end-of-tube attachments called Windy (a windsock that dances in the airflow) and Whirly (a spinning wheel that kicks balls as they exit), plus 10 dual-colored balls
- **Toobzters**: A set of five small plush characters with embroidered faces designed to be launched through the tubes instead of foam balls; these extend the recommended age range to 3-12

The system requires no tools or difficult assembly. Multiple sets can be combined for larger builds. The base set received coverage on Good Morning America and the Today Show in late 2023.

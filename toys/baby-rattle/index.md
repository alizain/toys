A baby rattle is a handheld toy designed to make noise when shaken. It consists of a handle or graspable body containing loose objects (beads, pellets, or bells) that create sound when the rattle moves. Rattles are among the earliest toys given to infants, with archaeological evidence dating back at least 2,500 years.

## What It Is

A baby rattle typically consists of two main parts: a handle or body that an infant can grasp, and an enclosed chamber containing small objects that produce sound when shaken. The overall size is usually 5-7 inches, small enough for tiny hands but large enough to prevent choking hazards.

Rattles come in a wide variety of materials:

- **Plastic**: Lightweight, often brightly colored, and easy to clean. Modern plastic rattles are typically BPA-free.
- **Wood**: Natural material with a softer, duller sound. Wooden rattles require smooth finishing and non-toxic sealants.
- **Fabric**: Soft and plush, sometimes incorporating crinkle materials. These are gentler for newborns.
- **Silicone**: Flexible and chewable, often serving double duty as teethers. Food-grade silicone is dishwasher-safe.

Shapes vary considerably: simple rings and dumbbells, animal figures, geometric shapes, and character designs. Many modern rattles incorporate additional features such as textured surfaces for tactile exploration, mirrors, teething rings, or attachment loops for strollers. The sounds produced range from the muted wooden clatter of beads to the brighter jingle of bells or metal elements.

## How Kids Play

Infants interact with rattles differently as they develop. Around 3-4 months, babies begin reaching for rattles when an adult shakes one nearby. Their initial grasps are reflexive, and they may hold the rattle briefly before dropping it.

By 4-6 months, babies develop more intentional grasping. They bring the rattle to their mouths to explore it, shake it deliberately (though sometimes accidentally at first), and watch it move. The cause-and-effect relationship becomes apparent to them: shaking produces sound.

From 6-9 months, infants gain more control over their movements. They shake rattles with intention, transfer them between hands, and may bang them against surfaces. Babies at this age often enjoy the sound variety they can create through different movements.

Rattle play is primarily solitary in nature, though caregivers frequently participate by shaking rattles to capture attention or playing simple back-and-forth games. For older infants approaching 9-12 months, rattles often transition to teething use as molars emerge, or babies move on to more complex toys like stacking blocks.

## Notes

Rattles have an unexpectedly long history. Archaeological finds include clay rattles from Iron Age Poland (around 2,500 years old) and ceramic rattle fragments from Bronze Age Syria dating to approximately 2500-2000 BCE. In Greco-Roman times, rattles were often shaped like pigs, associated with the goddess Demeter and rituals protecting babies.

The Greek philosopher Aristotle mentioned rattles in his Politics, noting that children should be given them to keep quiet and prevent them from breaking household items.

Silver rattles with coral handles were traditional christening gifts in England from at least the Elizabethan period. Coral was valued both for its smooth, cool surface (suitable for teething) and for superstitious beliefs that it protected children. In colonial America, elaborate gold and silver rattles incorporating bells, whistles, and coral teething sticks were prized possessions. John Hancock wrote to his wife in 1777 about his difficulty finding such a rattle to send for their child.

Modern rattles often combine multiple functions. The teether-rattle combination is particularly common, addressing both the infant's interest in sound and their need to soothe sore gums during teething. Safety standards (ASTM F963 in the US, EN71 in Europe) now regulate rattle construction, requiring rounded edges, secure enclosures, and non-toxic materials.

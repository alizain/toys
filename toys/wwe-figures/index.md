WWE wrestling figures are articulated action figures depicting professional wrestlers from World Wrestling Entertainment. Produced by Mattel since 2010, these figures represent current superstars and legends from wrestling's past, allowing children to recreate matches and storylines they watch on television or invent their own wrestling narratives.

## What It Is

Standard WWE figures stand approximately 6 inches tall. They are primarily made from PVC and ABS plastics, with some parts using softer materials for flexibility. The figures feature detailed facial sculpts using Mattel's TrueFX technology, which captures wrestler likenesses with realistic skin texture and expression.

Two main product lines exist: Basic and Elite. Basic figures have 14 points of articulation and retail around $10-12. Elite figures feature 25 points of articulation, including swappable hands, and cost approximately $35-45. Elite figures also include accessories such as championship belts, entrance gear, and character-specific items. Ultimate Edition figures go further with interchangeable facial expressions and outfit pieces.

Ring playsets are sold separately. The standard Superstar Ring is 14 inches across and features spring-loaded mat surfaces, pro-tension ropes, and interchangeable event aprons representing shows like RAW, SmackDown, WrestleMania, and SummerSlam. Additional accessories include barricades, commentator tables, steel cages, ladders, chairs, and ring steps that recreate the television arena experience.

## How Kids Play

Children stage wrestling matches between figures, lifting them to execute moves like slams, suplexes, and signature finishing moves. The high articulation on Elite figures allows poses that mimic specific wrestlers' trademark maneuvers. The spring-loaded ring mats add bounce during slam sequences.

Beyond single matches, children often create ongoing storylines involving rivalries, tag teams, and championship pursuits. They may narrate commentary during play, imitating announcers from televised broadcasts. Some children organize tournaments or recreate pay-per-view events match by match.

Collecting is a significant aspect for older children and adults. Figures spanning different eras allow collectors to assemble rosters of wrestlers who never appeared together in real life. Limited edition releases, variant packaging, and retailer exclusives drive collecting interest.

Younger children around age 6 tend to focus on physical play, making figures wrestle and crash into ring surfaces. Older children incorporate more narrative complexity, tracking win-loss records and developing feuds that span multiple play sessions. Play is often solo but becomes social when friends compare collections or stage matches together.

## Notes

The licensing relationship between WWE and toy manufacturers has passed through several companies over the decades: LJN produced figures from 1984-1989, Hasbro from 1990-1994, Jakks Pacific from 1996-2009, and Mattel from 2010 to present. Each era has distinct design characteristics that collectors recognize.

Basic figures serve as entry points for younger children or casual fans, while Elite figures target serious collectors and children who want more poseable figures. The price difference between the two lines is substantial, with Elite figures costing roughly three times as much.

Durability is generally high given the solid plastic construction, though smaller accessories like championship belts can be lost. The figures store easily standing upright or lying flat, and their standardized scale means all figures from the Mattel era are compatible with the same ring playsets.

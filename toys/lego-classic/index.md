LEGO Classic is a product line of basic brick sets designed for open-ended construction without themed storylines or licensed characters. The sets provide assortments of standard LEGO elements in multiple colors, intended for children to build whatever they imagine rather than following specific model instructions. First introduced in 2015, the line continues the tradition of unthemed LEGO building that dates back to the company's origins.

## What It Is

LEGO Classic sets contain collections of interlocking plastic bricks in various sizes, shapes, and colors. A typical set includes standard rectangular bricks in multiple heights, flat plates, slope pieces, and specialty elements such as wheels, tires, window frames, door frames, and decorative eyes. The Medium Creative Brick Box (10696) contains 484 pieces in 35 colors, while the Large Creative Brick Box (10698) includes 790 pieces in 33 colors. Sets come with green baseplates of varying sizes that serve as building surfaces. The bricks are made from ABS plastic and connect through a stud-and-tube coupling system. Most sets include a plastic storage container that doubles as the product packaging.

## How Kids Play

Children typically begin by sorting pieces by color or shape, spreading them across a floor or table surface. Initial building often follows the included instruction booklets, which show simple models like vehicles, animals, and buildings that can be constructed simultaneously from one set. After building suggested models, children frequently disassemble them and combine pieces in new configurations. Play sessions involve repeated cycles of construction, modification, and rebuilding. Older children sometimes challenge themselves to use all pieces in a single structure or to build without looking at instructions. Collaborative building occurs when multiple children work together, either on shared structures or side-by-side on individual projects. The storage container becomes part of the play routine, with children developing personal organization systems for their pieces.

## Notes

The brick separator tool, included in larger sets, reduces fingernail damage when pulling apart tightly connected pieces. Younger children in the 4-5 age range may require adult assistance with smaller elements and tight connections. Pieces from different LEGO Classic sets are fully compatible with each other and with other LEGO System products. The sets do not include minifigures, which distinguishes them from themed LEGO lines. Building instructions for additional models beyond those printed in the booklet are available on the LEGO website. Piece counts vary substantially across the product line, ranging from around 120 pieces in smaller sets to over 1,500 in the largest brick boxes. The storage containers in medium and large sets have compartmentalized lids that some users repurpose for sorting.

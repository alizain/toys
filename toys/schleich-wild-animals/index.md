Schleich Wild Life is a collection of animal figurines representing wildlife from ecosystems around the world. The German company Schleich has produced animal figures for over 85 years, with the Wild Life line covering mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and marine animals from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Antarctica, and the Americas. Individual figures range from small frogs to large whales, sold separately or in themed starter sets.

## What It Is

Each Wild Life figure is an injection-molded plastic sculpture depicting a specific animal species. The figures are hand-painted with species-appropriate coloring and markings. Sculpting includes textural details such as fur, scales, feathers, or skin folds. Figures vary in size roughly proportional to the actual animals, though not to a consistent scale across the collection. Most figures have a solid, weighted base or stand on their own feet. The plastic formulation includes softeners that make the material somewhat flexible rather than rigid, allowing figures to withstand being dropped or squeezed.

## How Kids Play

Children arrange figures into habitat groupings, often mixing species from similar environments such as African savanna animals or Arctic creatures. Figures frequently join other toys during imaginative play, appearing alongside blocks, playsets, or natural materials like sticks and leaves. Children act out predator-prey relationships, family groupings with adult and baby animal pairs, and migration or feeding scenarios. The figures often serve as characters in invented narratives. Older children may sort or categorize figures by continent, habitat, or animal classification. The collection also sees use in educational contexts where children identify animals and discuss their characteristics.

## Notes

The weight and density of these figures gives them a different feel than hollow plastic toys. They tip over less easily during play and make a solid sound when placed on hard surfaces. Paint can chip or wear on frequently handled figures, particularly on raised details like ears or tails. The collection has expanded over decades, so figures purchased years apart may show slight differences in sculpting style or paint application. Some animals are available as both adults and cubs or calves, allowing for family groupings. The starter sets provide a less expensive entry point than purchasing equivalent figures individually.

LEGO Duplo is a line of oversized building blocks produced by The LEGO Group, specifically designed for toddlers and preschool-aged children. First introduced in 1969, Duplo bricks are exactly twice the size of standard LEGO bricks in each dimension, making them easier for small hands to grasp and reducing choking hazards. The name "Duplo" derives from the Latin word for "double."

## What It Is

Duplo bricks measure approximately 32mm x 32mm for a 2x2 brick, with a height of 19.2mm for full-height pieces and 9.6mm for half-height plates. The standard 2x4 Duplo brick measures 32mm x 64mm. Each brick features the characteristic LEGO studs on top, though larger in proportion to accommodate the scaled-up design. Despite being larger, Duplo bricks maintain compatibility with standard LEGO bricks through a specific connection system where four standard LEGO studs fit onto one Duplo stud.

The product line includes more than just basic bricks. Sets contain Duplo figures (introduced in 1983), which resemble oversized LEGO minifigures but are molded as single pieces with moveable heads, arms, and legs rather than being separable into parts. The range encompasses animal figures, vehicles, train systems with track pieces, building plates, and specialized elements like windows, doors, wheels, and decorative pieces. Sets are organized around themes including farms, construction sites, trains, animals from various regions, and licensed properties such as Disney characters and Peppa Pig.

## How Kids Play

Children at 18 months typically begin by stacking blocks into towers and knocking them down, engaging in simple physical manipulation of the pieces. Around age 2, children develop the fine motor control to click two bricks together through trial and error, and they begin incorporating Duplo figures into basic pretend play scenarios. By age 3, children experiment with more complex structures, combining multiple brick types and using animal or character figures for storytelling. Children aged 4 and up engage in elaborate pretend-play sequences, constructing environments for their figures and acting out scenarios across built structures.

Train sets allow children to assemble track configurations and push trains along the rails, with some sets including battery-powered trains with sounds and lights. Farm and zoo sets prompt children to arrange animal figures in enclosures and act out feeding or caretaking routines. Vehicle sets invite pushing and rolling play, with figures that can be placed inside trucks, cars, and construction equipment. The large brick size means children can build structures quickly and see tangible results from their efforts, which supports sustained engagement.

## Notes

The compatibility between Duplo and standard LEGO bricks creates a natural transition path as children age out of the target range. A single Duplo stud accepts four standard LEGO studs, allowing mixed constructions. This backward compatibility means Duplo pieces retain usefulness even after children progress to smaller bricks.

The non-separable design of Duplo figures represents a deliberate safety choice, preventing small detachable parts from entering play environments intended for toddlers. The rail systems have evolved over time, with the current design featuring wider gauges than standard LEGO train tracks. Some Duplo sets include numbered bricks and shape-sorting elements that emphasize early counting and shape recognition alongside construction play.

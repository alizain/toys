A children's art easel is a freestanding or tabletop structure that provides a vertical surface for drawing, painting, and writing. Most easels designed for children are double-sided, offering a chalkboard on one side and a dry-erase whiteboard on the other, with a paper roll holder mounted at the top for painting on fresh sheets.

## What It Is

Children's art easels typically stand between 3 and 4.5 feet tall, with an A-frame design that allows the easel to support itself on the floor. The frame is most commonly made from pine wood or birch plywood, though plastic versions exist as well. Wood remains the dominant material, accounting for roughly three-quarters of easels on the market.

The standard configuration includes three working surfaces: a magnetic dry-erase whiteboard, a chalkboard (often also magnetic), and a paper roll holder with a paper cutter for tearing off fresh sheets. A tray or shelf runs along the bottom of each side to hold markers, chalk, paint cups, and brushes. Many easels include no-spill paint cups with lids that have brush holes to minimize mess.

Height-adjustable models allow the working surface to be raised as a child grows, typically accommodating children from about age 3 through age 8 or older. Tabletop versions offer the same multi-surface design in a smaller, portable format that sits on a table or counter. Three-sided easels exist for classroom or group settings, allowing multiple children to work simultaneously.

Common brands include Melissa & Doug, Step2, Crayola, IKEA (MALA), KidKraft, Little Partners, and Tiny Land. The IKEA MALA is notable as a widely available, budget-friendly option.

## How Kids Play

Children use art easels for drawing, painting, and writing activities. The vertical orientation encourages a standing posture and large arm movements, which differs from seated table work.

On the chalkboard side, children draw with chalk and erase with a cloth or eraser. The whiteboard side accepts dry-erase markers and, when magnetic, can hold magnetic letters, numbers, and shapes for spelling and counting activities. The paper roll provides a surface for painting with brushes and paints, or drawing with crayons and markers on a fresh sheet that can be torn off and kept.

Toddlers around 18 months to 2 years can begin using easels for scribbling and early mark-making, though most easels are designed for ages 3 and up. Preschool-aged children (3-5) use easels for painting, practicing letters and numbers, and open-ended drawing. School-aged children continue to use them for art projects and, in some households, for homework practice and educational activities.

Easels support both solo and parallel play. Double-sided designs allow two children to work on opposite sides at the same time, while three-sided easels accommodate small group activities in classroom settings.

## Notes

The paper roll feature distinguishes children's easels from adult versions. The inclusion of a child-safe paper cutter (usually a serrated plastic edge) allows children to tear off their work independently. Most paper rolls are 12 or 18 inches wide.

Cleanup varies by medium. Chalk and dry-erase markers wipe clean, making them lower-maintenance options. Paint requires more cleanup but remains popular because it offers a different tactile and visual experience. The no-spill paint cups included with many easels have become a near-standard feature.

Foldability matters for home use. Many easels collapse flat for storage, which is relevant for families with limited space. The IKEA MALA in particular is marketed for its easy assembly and compact storage.

The magnetic surfaces serve double duty: they hold paper with clips and enable play with magnetic letters and numbers, extending the easel's use into educational territory beyond pure art activities.

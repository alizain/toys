Kids hockey sticks are lightweight, scaled-down versions of street or floor hockey sticks designed for children to play informal hockey games. They come in sets that typically include two sticks and a ball or puck, providing the basic equipment needed for one-on-one play in driveways, backyards, or indoor spaces.

## What It Is

A kids hockey stick consists of two main parts: the shaft (the long handle) and the blade (the curved end used to hit the ball or puck). Children's sticks are typically made from ABS plastic, which provides flexibility and durability for playing on pavement, asphalt, and indoor floor surfaces. Some versions use wood shafts with polyethylene or ABS plastic blades, while foam-headed sticks exist for younger children or indoor play where safety is a concern.

Stick lengths vary by age group. Toddler and preschool sets feature sticks around 29-30 inches long. Elementary-age sticks range from 36-43 inches. Youth sticks for older children measure 37-46 inches. Most children's sticks have straight blades that work for both left-handed and right-handed players, unlike adult sticks which are typically curved for a specific hand orientation.

Sets marketed as starter kits usually include two sticks, allowing for immediate one-on-one play. Many also include a plastic puck, a foam ball, or both. The balls are typically low-density plastic or foam, around 65mm in diameter. Pucks are lightweight plastic or foam versions of ice hockey pucks, often around 3-4 inches in diameter. Some sets include pop-up goals or nets, though many children play with makeshift goals using cones, shoes, or other markers.

Floor hockey sticks designed for gym class and physical education programs are a related category. These often come in sets of 6-12 sticks in two colors for team play and feature non-marking blades that will not scuff gymnasium floors.

## How Kids Play

Children use hockey sticks to push, pass, and shoot a ball or puck toward a goal. In its simplest form, two players face off and try to score on each other using improvised goals. Games take place in driveways, streets, parking lots, basements, garages, and backyards. Indoor play on hardwood or tile floors is common, as is outdoor play on concrete, asphalt, or grass.

Younger children (ages 3-5) often start with basic stick handling, learning to control the ball or puck while moving. They may play without goals, simply passing back and forth or chasing the ball around. The lightweight construction of toddler sets allows small children to swing the sticks without difficulty.

Older children engage in more structured games. They set up goals, choose teams, and play with rules borrowed from ice or street hockey. Games may involve running while controlling the ball, passing to teammates, and shooting at a goalie. Unlike ice hockey, street and floor hockey do not involve body checking, and physical contact is limited. Children often play without protective gear beyond what they might already be wearing, though some use shin guards or gloves.

Solo practice is common. Children shoot at targets, practice stickhandling around obstacles, or shoot pucks against a wall or rebounder. Many ice hockey players develop their skills through hours of street hockey practice in their driveways.

## Notes

The distinction between "street hockey" and "floor hockey" is primarily about where the game is played. Street hockey occurs outdoors on hard surfaces like pavement. Floor hockey is the indoor gymnasium version. Kids hockey stick sets work for both contexts.

Ball selection affects play characteristics. Harder plastic balls travel faster and are suited for outdoor pavement. Softer foam balls move more slowly and cause less damage indoors. Temperature affects ball performance: warmer weather calls for harder balls (often orange or red), while softer balls (pink or yellow) work better in cool or cold conditions.

The sticks take significant abuse, particularly the blade, which scrapes against hard surfaces during play. ABS plastic blades are designed to handle this wear. Wood blades will eventually splinter or crack with regular outdoor use. Foam-headed sticks sacrifice durability and shot power for safety, making them appropriate for very young children or mixed-age play where injury prevention is a priority.

Storage is straightforward since the sets contain few pieces. The main challenge is keeping track of balls and pucks, which roll away and get lost. Many families accumulate several sticks over time as different sizes are needed for growing children.

Marvel Legends is a line of 6-inch (150mm) scale action figures based on Marvel Comics characters, produced by Hasbro. The line originated with Toy Biz in 2002 and transitioned to Hasbro in 2007. Figures typically retail between $25 and $50, with standard releases around $25-$28.

## What It Is

Marvel Legends figures stand approximately 6 inches tall and feature articulated joints throughout the body. Standard figures include over 20 points of articulation, with poseable head, arms, and legs. Premium "Maximum" series figures offer up to 35 points of articulation. The figures are constructed primarily from ABS plastic for structural parts and PVC plastic for softer details and accessories.

Each figure typically includes character-specific accessories such as alternate hands, weapons, or effect pieces. Many releases include a Build-A-Figure (BAF) piece, a component that combines with pieces from other figures in the same wave to construct a larger character. Packaging displays the figure visibly, and figures arrive in posed positions with accessories arranged separately.

## How Kids Play

Children use these figures to recreate scenes from Marvel films, television series, and comic books. The articulation allows for dynamic posing during imaginative play sequences involving battles and rescue scenarios. Kids collect multiple figures to stage group interactions between heroes and villains.

The Build-A-Figure mechanic encourages wave completion, as children work toward assembling larger characters by collecting individual releases. Figures are posed on shelves and desks between play sessions. Some children swap accessories between compatible figures to create custom configurations.

## Notes

The line transitioned from Toy Biz to Hasbro in January 2007. Hasbro discontinued the comic book pack-ins and finger articulation that characterized earlier releases. In 2020, Hasbro introduced pinless articulation joints, which conceal visible pins at elbow and knee joints.

Hasbro Pulse Premium members receive early access to certain releases. Standard figures ship in waves organized around themes such as film releases (Deadpool and Wolverine), comic storylines (X-Men), or anniversary celebrations. The 2025 Maximum line represents an expanded accessory and articulation tier positioned between standard releases and higher-end import figures.

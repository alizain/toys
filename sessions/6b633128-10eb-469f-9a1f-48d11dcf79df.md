# Session Summary: 6b633128-10eb-469f-9a1f-48d11dcf79df

**Session ID**: 6b633128-10eb-469f-9a1f-48d11dcf79df
**Date/Timestamp**: December 26, 2025
**Main Topic**: Adding sorting and filtering functionality to the toys website

## What was tried

The user requested:
1. Filter by each dimension using range sliders (min/max)
2. Sort by each dimension

The session used the `superpowers:brainstorming` skill to explore the problem before implementation.

## What was found/learned

**Current codebase structure discovered:**
- `scripts/compute-ratings.ts` - Bradley-Terry model for computing ratings from pairwise comparisons
- 7 rating dimensions: generativity, developmental_longevity, productive_challenge, sensory_engagement, expressive_range, social_affordance, practical_sustainability
- Each dimension scored 1-10, total out of 70
- Comparisons stored in `comparisons.csv`, ratings output to `ratings.csv`
- Toys stored as markdown files with frontmatter in `toys/<slug>/index.md`

## What was accomplished

The session initiated the brainstorming process for the filtering/sorting feature:
- Explored existing file structure
- Read compute-ratings.ts to understand data model
- Began the design exploration phase

## Key design considerations

For filtering:
- Range sliders for each of 7 dimensions
- Min and max values for each
- Need to determine UI placement and interaction patterns

For sorting:
- Sort by any of the 7 dimensions
- Sort by total score
- Ascending/descending options

## Open questions

Session appears to have ended during the exploration/brainstorming phase. Questions to resolve:
- Where should filters live in the UI?
- Should filtering persist in URL state (nuqs)?
- Should there be presets (e.g., "Most Creative", "Best for Development")?
- How to handle range slider UX for 7 dimensions without overwhelming the UI?

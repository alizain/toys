A baby walker is a wheeled device designed to support infants and toddlers as they learn to stand and take their first steps. The term encompasses two distinct product types: sit-in walkers (which suspend the child in a fabric seat) and push walkers (which children stand behind and push forward). Push walkers are the more commonly recommended type today, as sit-in walkers have been banned in several countries due to safety concerns.

## What It Is

Push walkers consist of a wheeled base with an upright handle or frame that children grasp while walking. They typically feature a wide, stable base to prevent tipping and rubber-coated wheels that provide grip and protect flooring.

**Wooden push walkers** are made from natural wood or MDF, often finished with non-toxic paints and varnishes. They tend to be heavier and sturdier, which some parents prefer for stability. Many wooden walkers include a basket or cargo area where children can place toys. The Hape Wonder Walker is a notable example of this style.

**Plastic push walkers** are lighter and more affordable. They often incorporate electronic features such as light-up buttons, music, and interactive panels. Popular models include the VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker and Fisher-Price Learn with Me Zebra Walker. These frequently convert between floor-play activity centers and push walkers.

Many walkers feature activity panels on the front with elements like shape sorters, spinning gears, piano keys, bead mazes, and flip boards. Some models offer adjustable speed settings via wheel resistance controls, allowing parents to slow the walker for newer walkers and increase speed as children gain confidence.

Sizes vary, but most push walkers stand roughly waist-height for a standing infant, with handles positioned so children can grip them comfortably while upright.

## How Kids Play

Children typically begin using push walkers when they can sit independently and are starting to pull themselves up to stand, usually around 6 to 12 months of age. The walker provides a stable support they can grip while taking assisted steps.

**Early use (6-9 months):** Children often engage with the activity panel while seated on the floor, pressing buttons, spinning gears, and exploring the interactive elements. They may pull up on the walker handle to practice standing.

**Learning to walk (9-15 months):** Children stand behind the walker, grip the handle, and push it forward while taking steps. The walker moves with them, providing continuous support. Some children walk in straight lines; others learn to steer around obstacles. Many children load toys, stuffed animals, or other objects into walker baskets and push them around.

**Later use (12-18 months):** As children become more confident walkers, the push walker often transitions into a cargo toy for transporting objects around the house. Children who have mastered walking independently may still enjoy pushing the walker as part of imaginative play.

Play is typically solo, though children sometimes push walkers toward caregivers or siblings as a social interaction. Sessions are generally kept to 15-20 minutes at a time, with adult supervision.

## Notes

The distinction between sit-in walkers and push walkers is significant. Sit-in walkers, where a child sits in a suspended fabric seat with wheels underneath, are associated with approximately 2,000 emergency room visits annually in the United States and have been banned in Canada and several other countries. Push walkers have a different safety profile because children stand on their own feet and can let go if they lose balance.

Research on whether any type of walker helps children learn to walk faster is mixed. Some studies suggest walker use may actually delay independent walking by two to three weeks. The devices are not considered necessary for development, though many families find them useful for keeping mobile babies entertained.

Wheel resistance is a notable feature that varies across models. Walkers with adjustable or naturally higher resistance move more slowly, which can help newer walkers maintain control. Rubber wheel coatings serve dual purposes: preventing floor scratches and adding friction to slow the walker on smooth surfaces. Some walkers that work well on carpet may move too quickly on hardwood floors without adequate resistance.

The activity panel features on many plastic walkers can be a source of ongoing interest even after children have learned to walk, extending the useful life of the product.

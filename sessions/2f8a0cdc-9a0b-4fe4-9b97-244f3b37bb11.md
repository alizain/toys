# Session Summary

## Session ID
`2f8a0cdc-9a0b-4fe4-9b97-244f3b37bb11`

## Date/Timestamp
2025-12-26T17:16:24.514Z

## Main Topic
Parallel subagent toy comparison/rating system

## Session Context
This session appears to be a continuation or follow-up to previous work on a parallel subagent toy comparison system. The session file contains summary metadata from three prior conversation branches:

1. "Parallel subagent toy comparisons without credits"
2. "Parallel subagents rate toys by dimension"
3. "Parallel toy comparison rating system"

## What was tried
The user executed the `/usage` command to check usage statistics. This was the only explicit action taken in this session.

## What was found/learned
This session was primarily a status check or brief continuation. The session file structure suggests this was part of a larger project involving:
- Parallel execution of subagents
- A toy comparison or rating system
- Some kind of multi-dimensional rating approach

## What was accomplished
- Checked usage statistics via the `/usage` command
- The status dialog was dismissed after displaying usage information

## Key observations
This was an extremely brief session - essentially just a usage check. The real substantive work appears to have been done in the parent sessions referenced in the summary metadata.

## Open questions
- What was the outcome of the parallel subagent toy comparison work in the parent sessions?
- Why was the credits aspect removed (based on "without credits" summary)?
- What dimensions were used for rating toys?
- Is there additional context in the linked sessions (referenced by leafUuid values)?

*Note: This session file contained minimal content - only summary metadata and a single usage command. The actual development work was done in parent/related sessions.*

Munchkin is a baby product company founded in 1991 that produces a range of bath toys for infants and toddlers. Their bath toy line includes water squirters shaped like animals, floating toys, stacking cups, foam letters and numbers, and temperature-sensing rubber ducks. Products are widely available at mass retailers and online stores.

## What It Is

Munchkin bath toys fall into several categories. Squirt toys are soft, squeezable figures shaped like ocean animals (pufferfish, penguin, jellyfish) or wild animals (elephant, giraffe, koala, pangolin). These toys have a hollow body with a small opening that draws in and expels water when compressed. The Ocean Squirts and Wild Animal Squirts sets each contain eight figures sized for small hands to grip.

Stacking and pouring toys include the Caterpillar Spillers (also called Connect-a-Cup), a set of seven nesting cups with holes in the bottom for water straining. Some cups connect together; others feature spinner wheels that rotate when water passes through. The Falls bath toy uses suction cups to attach cup-shaped components to the tub wall in vertical arrangements.

The White Hot Safety Duck is a floating rubber duck with a heat-sensitive panel on its underside that displays the word "HOT" when bath water reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Foam letters and numbers (36-piece sets) stick to wet tub walls and float on the water surface.

Musical bath toys include the Bath Beats set with a xylophone (Dingray), a drum-like toy (Octodrum), and shaker instruments shaped like starfish. These are designed for children 12 months and older.

## How Kids Play

Children squeeze the squirt toys underwater to fill them, then squeeze again to shoot streams of water. Toddlers often aim at targets, each other, or themselves. Some children hold the toys underwater and watch air bubbles escape from the openings.

With stacking cups, children pour water from one cup to another, watching it strain through the holes. They stack the cups into towers on the tub edge or nest them inside each other. The cups with spinner wheels attract attention as water makes the components rotate.

Foam letters and numbers get pressed onto wet tub walls where they adhere temporarily. Children peel them off and reposition them, sometimes spelling words or arranging numbers in sequence with adult guidance. The pieces also float, and children scoop them from the water surface.

The temperature-sensing duck floats in the bath. Adults use it to check water temperature before bathing a child. Children play with it as a standard rubber duck, pushing it underwater and releasing it to bob back up.

## Notes

Material composition varies across the product line. The Caterpillar Spillers are marketed as BPA-free, PVC-free, and phthalate-free. Many squirt toys contain phthalate-free PVC. The foam letters and numbers are listed as non-toxic foam. Munchkin's website indicates not all products are BPA-free.

Squirt toys with sealed bodies can develop mold inside over time if water remains trapped. The CleanSqueeze line addresses this with toys that twist apart for drying. Standard squirt toys require squeezing out water after each use and periodic inspection of the interior.

The Wild Animal Squirts set features endangered species (pangolin, snow leopard, rhino, polar bear) and includes information about wildlife conservation, introducing an educational element beyond water play.

Age recommendations vary by product: squirt toys and floating toys are typically labeled for 9 months and up, foam letters for 18 months and up, and musical bath toys for 12 months and up. The company was founded by Steven B. Dunn with a focus on children's products.

Botley is a screen-free coding robot manufactured by Learning Resources, designed to introduce young children to fundamental programming concepts. The robot operates without a phone, tablet, or computer, relying instead on a handheld remote programmer that allows children to input command sequences. Botley won the 2019 Innovative Toy of the Year award and has become a popular entry point for early STEM education in both home and classroom settings.

## What It Is

Botley is a small wheeled robot with a rounded, friendly appearance. The original version (often called Botley 1.0) can be programmed to execute up to 80 steps in a single sequence. A later iteration, Botley 2.0, extends this capacity to 150 steps and adds features such as music playback, light shows, and the ability for multiple units to operate in the same room without interference.

The robot comes in various configurations. The 77-piece Activity Set includes the robot itself, a remote programmer, two detachable robot arms, 40 coding cards, six double-sided floor tiles, 27 obstacle pieces (cones, cubes, and other shapes), and a starter guide with coding challenges. Accessory packs such as the Crashin' Construction set add crane attachments, plow arms, and additional building pieces.

Botley requires five AAA batteries total: three for the robot and two for the remote programmer. The robot performs best on smooth, hard surfaces such as tables, hardwood floors, or play mats. Carpeted areas may reduce traction and affect movement accuracy, though low-pile carpets generally work adequately.

## How Kids Play

Children program Botley by entering directional commands on the remote programmer, then pressing a button to transmit the sequence to the robot. The robot executes the stored instructions in order, moving forward, backward, or turning based on the programmed steps. This process teaches children to think sequentially and plan ahead, as they must visualize the entire path before Botley begins moving.

Basic play involves setting up obstacle courses using the included tiles and building pieces, then programming Botley to navigate through them. Children learn debugging by observing when Botley does not reach the intended destination and adjusting their code accordingly. The robot includes object detection, allowing it to sense obstacles in its path. Using if/then logic, children can program Botley to take alternative routes when it encounters an obstacle.

More advanced activities include looping commands, where children create repeating instruction sets to move Botley efficiently through patterns. A black-line follow mode allows Botley to track lines drawn or printed on surfaces. The coding cards provide visual aids for planning sequences before entering them on the remote. Children can also use the detachable arms to push objects or interact with the included accessories.

Botley 2.0 adds six directional options instead of four, a light sensor that makes the robot's eyes glow, and 16 transformation sounds (such as police car or train). It also includes a memory game called "Botley Says" where children repeat increasingly complex sequences.

## Notes

The screen-free design means children interact physically with the robot and remote rather than through an app. This approach reduces screen time while still teaching coding logic, though it also means there is no visual programming interface or progress tracking.

Younger children (ages 5-6) typically focus on basic sequencing and obstacle navigation. Older children within the target range can explore conditional logic and loops. Some educators note that children over age 8 who have prior coding experience may find Botley's capabilities limiting and might benefit from more advanced robotics kits.

The robot is constructed from durable plastic intended to withstand regular use in classroom environments. The chunky obstacle pieces are sized for small hands. Multiple Botley 2.0 units can operate simultaneously in the same room, making the robot suitable for group activities or classroom settings where several children program robots at once.

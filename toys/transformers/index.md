Transformers are action figures produced by Hasbro that convert between robot forms and alternate modes such as vehicles, animals, or devices. The toy line launched in 1984, combining molds from Japanese manufacturers Takara's Diaclone and Micro Change lines under a unified brand. The franchise continues today with multiple product lines spanning different price points and complexity levels.

## What It Is

Each Transformers figure is a single toy that reconfigures between two or more distinct forms through a series of folds, rotations, and repositioning of parts. The primary form is typically a humanoid robot, while the alternate mode varies by character: common disguises include cars, trucks, jets, tanks, and animals. Figures range in size from approximately 3 inches to over 12 inches in robot mode, organized into size classes such as Core, Deluxe, Voyager, Leader, and Commander.

Construction is predominantly ABS plastic with polycarbonate used for transparent elements like windows and light-piped eyes. Flexible parts such as tires use PVC, while internal mechanisms employ POM plastic. Metal screws and pins hold components together. Die-cast metal parts appear in premium collector lines like Masterpiece but are uncommon in standard retail figures. Figures typically feature multiple points of articulation in robot mode, including ball joints at shoulders, hips, and heads, with hinged elbows and knees.

## How Kids Play

Children manipulate the figures through the transformation sequence, converting back and forth between modes. This process involves following a specific series of steps: rotating limbs, folding panels, extending or retracting parts, and clicking components into place. Some children memorize transformation steps and perform them quickly; others work through the process methodically or experiment with partial transformations.

In robot mode, the figures serve as action figures for imaginative play, often staged in conflicts between Autobot and Decepticon factions. Children pose figures, create battle scenarios, and incorporate dialogue. Vehicle or beast modes allow for rolling, flying motions, or creature roleplay. Many children collect multiple figures to build factions and create group scenes.

Complexity varies significantly by size class and product line. Simpler figures designed for younger children may transform in 3-5 steps, while collector-oriented figures can require 30 or more distinct manipulations. Some children gravitate toward simpler figures for rapid conversion during play; others seek out complex transformations as puzzles to master.

## Notes

The transformation mechanism creates an inherent tension in figure design: features that benefit robot mode (poseability, proportions, detail) often conflict with requirements for a convincing alternate mode, and vice versa. Different product lines prioritize these aspects differently.

Durability has improved since the original 1984 releases. Modern plastics are more flexible and resistant to stress fractures than early Generation 1 materials. However, the mechanical nature of transformation means joints can loosen over time with repeated use, and small protruding parts remain vulnerable to breakage.

The franchise has maintained continuous production since 1984, making it one of the longer-running action figure lines. Character designs have varied considerably across different media adaptations, and toy lines frequently release multiple versions of popular characters like Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron in different styles, scales, and price points.

Current product lines include Generations Legacy (combining characters from various continuities), Studio Series (based on live-action and animated films), and EarthSpark (tied to the animated series of the same name). Collaborative products pair Transformers with other franchises, creating figures that transform into vehicles from properties like Top Gun, Ghostbusters, and Back to the Future.

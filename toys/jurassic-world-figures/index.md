Mattel produces licensed dinosaur action figures based on the Jurassic World and Jurassic Park film franchise. The line includes dinosaur figures ranging from small 3-inch models to large 12-inch or greater specimens, along with human character figures and themed playsets. Mattel has held the Jurassic World toy license since 2017 and continues to release new figures tied to film releases and animated series.

## What It Is

The Jurassic World figure line consists of plastic dinosaur action figures and human character figures produced in multiple size categories and collection tiers. Standard figures use a 3.75-inch scale for human characters, with dinosaurs sized proportionally to that scale.

Dinosaur figures typically feature movable joints at the legs, arms, tail, and jaw, allowing for posing. Many include action features such as jaw-snapping mechanisms, strike attacks activated by tail movement, or electronic roaring sounds. Figure sizes range from Danger Pack figures (approximately 7 inches long, 3 inches tall) to Super Colossal figures exceeding 12 inches in height.

The line includes several distinct product tiers:
- **Danger Pack**: Small poseable figures, typically sold individually
- **Wild Roar / MEGA Roar**: Mid-sized figures with sound features
- **Gigantic Trackers**: Larger figures with attack mechanisms
- **Super Colossal**: Very large display-oriented figures
- **Hammond Collection**: Premium figures with higher articulation (up to 20 points) and screen-accurate paint applications, targeting collectors
- **Imaginext Jurassic World**: Simplified figures designed for younger children (ages 3+)

Human figures depict characters from the films including scientists, park staff, and protagonists. Some sets pair human figures with dinosaurs. Playsets recreate locations from the films and may include vehicles, containment structures, and lab equipment.

## How Kids Play

Children use these figures to recreate scenes from Jurassic World films or to create original dinosaur adventure scenarios. Common play patterns include staging dinosaur escapes, battles between dinosaurs, and rescue missions where human figures interact with the dinosaurs.

The figures support both solo and group play. A child might set up a scene with multiple dinosaurs and human figures, moving them through a narrative. The action features (jaw snapping, strike attacks, roaring sounds) give physical feedback during play.

Younger children (ages 4-6) tend toward simpler interactions: making dinosaurs roar, having them "chase" figures, and knocking things over. Older children (ages 7-10) often develop more elaborate scenarios with multiple figures and may organize figures by species or create display arrangements.

The figures integrate with playsets when available, and children frequently combine them with other toy lines (vehicles, buildings, generic dinosaurs) to expand their play environment. Some figures include a tracking code that unlocks digital content in a companion mobile app, allowing children to scan physical figures and interact with digital versions.

## Notes

Mattel divides the line between mass-market toys (sold at general retailers, ages 4+) and the Hammond Collection (sold through specialty channels, ages 8+, higher price point). The Hammond Collection figures have significantly more articulation and detailed paint work, resembling collector-grade figures while remaining toys rather than static display pieces.

The figure line refreshes with each new film or animated series release. The 2025 "Jurassic World Rebirth" film has prompted a new wave of figures. The Chaos Theory animated series on Netflix has its own sub-line.

Figure durability is generally high for the standard line; the plastic construction withstands drops and rough play. Joints can loosen over time with heavy use. The larger figures with electronic features require batteries.

Storage is straightforward for small and medium figures. The Super Colossal figures require substantial shelf space. Sets with many small accessories (fencing pieces, lab equipment) are more prone to piece loss.

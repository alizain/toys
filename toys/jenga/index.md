Jenga is a stacking block game created by Leslie Scott and currently manufactured by Hasbro. The name derives from the Swahili word "kujenga," meaning "to build." The game was first sold commercially in 1983 and has since sold over 100 million sets worldwide.

## What It Is

The classic Jenga set contains 54 precision-crafted hardwood blocks and a stacking sleeve. Each block measures approximately 1.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 7.5 cm (0.59 in x 0.98 in x 2.95 in), following a 1:3:5 ratio where each block is three times as long as it is wide and one-fifth as thick as its length. The blocks are typically made from alder or paulownia wood. Blocks have small, intentional variations in their dimensions, creating slight differences in weight and friction that affect how easily each piece slides.

## How Kids Play

Players begin by constructing a tower using the stacking sleeve, placing three blocks per layer in alternating perpendicular directions. During play, each player removes one block from anywhere below the highest completed layer using only one hand, then places it on top of the tower. The tower grows taller and increasingly unstable as more blocks are relocated. Play continues until the tower collapses. The last player to successfully complete a turn before the collapse occurs is considered the winner.

## Notes

The game originated in Ghana in the early 1970s, where Scott and her siblings played with wooden blocks cut from sawmill scraps. Scott brought the game to Oxford in 1974 and later commercialized it. The blocks' slight manufacturing variations are a deliberate design choice that adds unpredictability to gameplay, as some blocks slide more easily than others. The game was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong National Museum of Play in 2020. Giant versions exist with blocks up to 7.15 inches long that can build towers over 5 feet tall.

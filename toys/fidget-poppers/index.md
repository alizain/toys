Pop It fidget toys are reusable sensory toys made of silicone with rows of bubble-like dimples that can be pushed in and out. When pressed, the bubbles make a soft popping sound and flip to the other side, allowing the toy to be turned over and used again indefinitely. The design was originally conceived in 1975 by Theo and Ora Coster, though the silicone version became widely popular in 2021.

## What It Is

A Pop It consists of a flat silicone tray containing multiple hemispherical bubbles arranged in rows. The bubbles are molded into the silicone so that when pushed from one side, they invert and protrude from the opposite side. The material is typically food-grade, non-BPA silicone, chosen for its durability, flexibility, and washability. Early prototypes used rubber, but silicone allowed for cost-effective mass production.

Pop Its come in numerous shapes and configurations. Common forms include simple geometric shapes like circles, squares, octagons, and hearts. Novelty versions take the shape of animals (dinosaurs, whales), food items (cupcakes, fruit), video game controllers, and licensed characters. Sizes range from small keychain attachments and wearable bracelets to large boards with dozens of bubbles. Colors are often bright, with rainbow gradients being particularly common.

## How Kids Play

The primary interaction involves pressing bubbles to hear and feel the pop, then flipping the toy to repeat the process. Children often press bubbles rapidly, one at a time, or push entire rows at once. The activity can be done with one hand or two.

Pop Its can be used for structured games. In one common game, players take turns pressing any number of connected bubbles in a single row, and the player who pops the last bubble loses. Another game involves hiding a small object like a marble under a bubble and having another player try to find it.

In classroom and therapeutic settings, children use Pop Its for counting exercises, practicing skip counting, or marking syllables in words by pressing one bubble per syllable. Some children use them during tasks that require sustained attention or while listening to instruction.

## Notes

The mechanical sensation is similar to popping bubble wrap, but unlike bubble wrap, Pop Its can be used repeatedly. The popping sound is quieter than actual bubble wrap.

The toy gained mainstream attention through social media in 2020-2021, particularly after videos featuring the toy circulated on TikTok. It had existed in specialty toy stores and special education contexts for several years prior.

Pop Its are marketed for stress relief and sensory stimulation. They are used by children and adults, and are sometimes recommended for individuals who benefit from repetitive tactile input. The minimum recommended age is 3 years due to potential choking hazards from small attachments or if the silicone is damaged.

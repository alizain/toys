Lite-Brite Touch is a modernized version of the classic Lite-Brite toy, released in 2023 by Basic Fun. Unlike the original 1967 toy that used translucent plastic pegs pushed through black paper, this version replaces pegs with touch-sensitive LED buttons. The device operates on 3 AA batteries or via USB power.

## What It Is

Lite-Brite Touch is a portable, battery-operated light board measuring approximately 6.75 x 5.75 x 1 inches and weighing about 1.25 pounds. The front panel contains 100 individual LED buttons arranged in a grid. Each button cycles through seven colors when pressed repeatedly: the first press illuminates the button, and subsequent presses change its color. The plastic housing has a built-in speaker for game sounds and a control interface along the edge for switching between modes. The unit includes 12 printed design templates that can be placed over or referenced alongside the button grid. Unlike the classic Lite-Brite, there are no loose pegs or consumable paper sheets.

## How Kids Play

Children press individual buttons on the grid to illuminate them, pressing repeatedly to cycle through available colors. The device offers three primary modes. In Create mode, children build images one button at a time, either following the included templates or designing freeform pictures. Up to five images can be saved to internal memory and recalled later. Play mode includes three games: a snake game where players navigate around obstacles while collecting items, a brick-breaking game using paddle mechanics, and a pattern-matching game played against a timer. Animate mode displays one of five preset light animations across the grid, including patterns like fireworks, lightning, zigzags, and rainbows. Children often use the toy individually for quiet creative time, though the games support two-player turn-taking. The compact size allows for use during car trips or other portable contexts.

## Notes

The shift from physical pegs to touch buttons changes the tactile experience. The original Lite-Brite required pushing pegs through paper, producing distinct resistance and a satisfying click. The Touch version provides softer button feedback. The elimination of pegs removes the sorting and fine-motor peg-insertion aspect of the original, but also removes the need for replacement paper templates and the risk of lost or scattered pegs. The LED buttons produce cool light rather than heat, unlike earlier bulb-based versions. The save feature addresses a limitation of the original, where creations were tied to consumable paper sheets. Battery life varies with use intensity; USB power provides an alternative for stationary play.

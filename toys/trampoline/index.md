A trampoline is a piece of recreational equipment consisting of a fabric jumping surface stretched taut within a frame, used for bouncing. Children's trampolines come in two main categories: large backyard models (typically 8-16 feet in diameter) with safety enclosures, and smaller indoor mini trampolines (around 36 inches) often equipped with handlebars for stability.

## What It Is

Backyard trampolines feature a circular or rectangular steel frame, typically galvanized to resist rust, supporting a woven polypropylene mat. The bounce comes from either galvanized steel springs connecting the mat to the frame, or in springless designs, flexible fiberglass composite rods positioned beneath the jumping surface. Safety enclosures made of mesh netting attach to poles around the perimeter, and foam padding covered in weather-resistant vinyl shields the springs and frame edge.

Mini trampolines designed for indoor use share similar construction principles on a smaller scale. These units typically stand on six to eight legs with non-slip rubber feet, and many include a foam-padded handlebar for the child to grip while jumping. Some mini trampolines use elastic bands rather than metal springs, producing a quieter bounce and eliminating pinch points.

## How Kids Play

On backyard trampolines, children bounce in the center of the mat, often attempting to jump progressively higher. Play frequently involves repetitive simple jumping, with some children adding seated bounces, knee drops, or controlled falls onto their backs before springing upright again. When multiple children are present, turn-taking becomes part of the activity, as single-jumper use is standard practice.

Mini trampoline use tends toward shorter, more contained sessions. Younger children often hold the handlebar with both hands while bouncing in place. The activity serves as a movement break, with children jumping for several minutes before moving on to other play. Some children incorporate counting or songs into their bouncing rhythm.

## Notes

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under six years old should not use backyard trampolines, as their bones are still developing and more susceptible to fractures. Mini trampolines marketed for toddlers exist but are designed for low-height bouncing with handlebar support.

Approximately 75 percent of trampoline injuries occur when more than one person is jumping on the mat simultaneously. The size differential between jumpers can cause unexpected force transfer, sending the lighter child higher than anticipated.

Springless trampoline designs place the flexible rods beneath the jumping surface rather than at the perimeter, which eliminates the gap between mat and frame where feet can slip through and removes exposed springs as a pinch hazard.

Weather affects outdoor trampoline use significantly. UV exposure degrades the polypropylene mat over time, and wet surfaces become slippery. Many families cover their trampolines or store mini trampolines indoors between uses.

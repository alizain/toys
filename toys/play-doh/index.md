Play-Doh is a modeling compound manufactured by Hasbro. Originally developed in the 1950s as a wallpaper cleaner, it was reformulated as a children's toy in 1956 by Rainbow Crafts Company after a nursery school teacher discovered its potential for art projects. The product was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1998.

## What It Is

Play-Doh is a soft, pliable compound sold in small plastic cans. The material has a smooth texture that results from mineral oil coating the flour and salt particles, reducing friction. It feels slightly moist but not sticky when fresh. The compound comes in a wide range of colors, from primary colors to pastels and specialty shades. When left exposed to air, it gradually loses moisture and hardens; returning it to its sealed container preserves its pliability. The product has a distinctive scent that many people find recognizable. Play-Doh contains wheat and is not intended to be eaten.

## How Kids Play

Children manipulate Play-Doh through squishing, rolling, flattening, poking, and tearing. They press it between their palms, squeeze it through their fingers, and pound it against surfaces. Using rolling pins or cylindrical objects, they flatten the compound into sheets. Cookie cutters and plastic molds create shapes when pressed into rolled dough. Children make snakes by rolling pieces between their hands and a flat surface, then cut these into segments with plastic knives or child-safe scissors. They combine colors by kneading different pieces together, which eventually results in a blended hue. Some children build three-dimensional forms by stacking and attaching pieces, while others prefer to focus on the repetitive sensory experience of squishing and reshaping without creating specific objects.

## Notes

Mixed colors cannot be separated once blended. The compound leaves residue on fabric and carpet that can be difficult to remove when fresh but vacuums up more readily once dried. Small dried pieces frequently appear under furniture and in carpet fibers in homes where Play-Doh is used regularly. The material can clog extrusion toys if pushed through too forcefully or if partially dried compound enters the mechanism. Children sometimes eat small amounts despite the unpleasant salty taste; the product is labeled non-toxic. The distinctive smell persists on hands after play and transfers to other objects children touch.

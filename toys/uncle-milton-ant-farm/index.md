The Uncle Milton Ant Farm is a live ant habitat that has been in continuous production since 1956. Created by Milton Levine after watching ants at a Fourth of July picnic, the product allows observation of harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex californicus) tunneling through sand within a flat, transparent enclosure. Over 20 million units have been sold since its introduction.

## What It Is

The Ant Farm consists of two thin transparent plastic panels held in a frame, typically with a green or wood-grain finish. The narrow gap between the panels is filled with fine tunneling sand. Standard models measure approximately 9-10 inches wide by 6 inches tall with a depth of about half an inch to one inch. The thin profile forces ants to build tunnels that remain visible from outside.

The habitat includes a removable top frame for adding ants and supplies. Some models feature Antway connector ports on the sides, allowing multiple habitats to be linked together. The kit typically includes tunneling sand, a water dropper, ant food, and an instruction manual called the Ant Watcher's Guide. Live ants are ordered separately and arrive by mail in a sealed tube.

## How Kids Play

Children set up the habitat by adding moistened sand, then introducing refrigerator-cooled ants through the top opening. The cooling makes ants sluggish and easier to transfer safely. Once warmed, ants begin digging within hours to days.

Daily observation becomes the primary activity. Children watch ants excavate tunnels, construct chambers, move sand grains, and interact with one another. A magnifying glass (included with some kits) allows closer examination. Kids learn to track tunnel progress, identify patterns in ant movement, and observe how ants dispose of debris or deceased colony members.

Care routines involve weekly feeding and watering using the provided dropper. The manual suggests small leaf pieces from fruit trees as supplemental food. Children must avoid overwatering, direct sunlight exposure, and physical disturbance of the tunnels.

## Notes

The Ant Farm uses harvester ants rather than common household species. These ants can bite or sting when handled, so direct contact is discouraged. The product ships ants from a single colony to prevent territorial fighting that occurs when mixing ants from different sources.

Ant lifespan in the habitat ranges from a few weeks to approximately three months. No queen is included in standard shipments, so the colony cannot reproduce or persist indefinitely. The product is sometimes described as escape-proof and break-resistant.

The original 1956 model sold for $1.29. A walk-through version was constructed for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, and a twelve-foot model appeared at the 1965 New York World's Fair.

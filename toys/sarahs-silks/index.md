Sarah's Silks play silks are square pieces of lightweight silk fabric designed for open-ended play. The standard playsilk measures 35 x 35 inches and is made from 5 momme weight Habotai silk, a traditional Chinese silk variety. The company, founded in 1994 in California, produces these silks in a range of solid colors and has roots in Waldorf education philosophy.

## How Kids Play

Children drape playsilks over furniture to construct forts, tents, and enclosed spaces. The fabric becomes capes, cloaks, skirts, and costume elements when tied or wrapped around the body. Kids lay silks flat to represent water, grass, roads, or other terrain for small figure play. The material serves as doll blankets, slings, and swaddling for caregiving play. Children hold silks while running or dancing, watching the fabric billow and trail. Light passing through the translucent silk creates colored shadows and visual effects when used as canopy covers. Multiple silks combine to build larger structures or layered costumes.

## Notes

The 5 momme weight produces a very lightweight, flowing fabric that moves easily with minimal effort from small hands. Silk holds dye vibrantly, resulting in saturated colors that remain visible when light passes through. The fabric has a smooth, cool tactile quality distinct from cotton or synthetic materials. Playsilks wrinkle when bunched but can be ironed to restore smoothness. The square shape means all edges are equivalent, allowing any corner to serve as the top of a cape or the starting point for wrapping. Unlike structured costumes, the undefined form requires children to decide what the silk represents in each play session.

A croquet set is an outdoor lawn game where players use mallets to hit balls through a series of wire hoops (called wickets) arranged in a course on grass. The game can be played individually or in teams, with players taking turns and following a set sequence through the wickets. Croquet sets range from simplified children's versions with animal-themed pieces to standard backyard sets that accommodate multiple players.

## What It Is

A standard croquet set includes several components: mallets, balls, wickets, and stakes. The number of pieces varies by set size, with 4-player and 6-player configurations being most common.

**Mallets** have a long handle with a cylindrical head at the end. Adult mallets are typically around 36 inches long, while children's mallets range from 25 to 28 inches. The mallet head has two flat striking faces on opposite ends. Handles are usually made of wood, though some budget sets use plastic.

**Balls** are sized to fit through the wickets with some clearance. Standard balls are about 3.5 inches in diameter. Each ball is a different color to identify players (blue, red, black, yellow are traditional; green and orange appear in 6-player sets). Balls may be solid wood, solid plastic, or composite materials.

**Wickets** (also called hoops) are U-shaped wire arches that stick into the ground. Standard backyard sets include 9 wickets, though some use 6. They are typically made of coated steel wire. Children's sets sometimes replace standard wickets with freestanding animal-shaped targets.

**Stakes** (usually 2) mark the start and end of the course. They are wooden or plastic posts that players must hit to complete the game.

Many sets include a carrying bag or case for storage and transport. Some children's sets add whimsical elements like animal-shaped balls (frogs, tigers, birds) or decorative hoops shaped like woodland creatures.

## How Kids Play

The basic play pattern involves setting up the wickets in a course on the lawn, then taking turns hitting balls with mallets to knock them through the wickets in sequence. Players strike their ball by swinging the mallet between their legs or from the side.

Younger children (ages 3-5) often play simplified versions. They may simply enjoy hitting the ball and watching it roll, or try to knock it through nearby wickets without following a set course. Children's sets with animal-shaped targets make this easier since the targets are freestanding and more visible.

Older children (ages 6 and up) can follow the actual game rules: moving through wickets in order, earning bonus shots for going through a wicket or hitting another player's ball, and racing to complete the course first. The strategic elements emerge as children learn to block opponents, set up their next shot, or use the "croquet" shot (hitting two balls at once after making contact with an opponent's ball).

Croquet is inherently social. While solo practice is possible, the game is designed for 2 to 6 players taking turns. It works well for mixed-age groups because adults can play alongside children using the same equipment, and the turn-based nature allows everyone to participate regardless of skill level.

The game requires enough outdoor space to set up a course. A regulation court is 100 by 50 feet, but backyard versions can be scaled down proportionally. The wickets stick into grass or soft ground; some indoor sets use weighted bases for hard floors.

## Notes

Children's croquet sets vary substantially in quality and design. The most basic sets use thin wire wickets that bend easily and lightweight plastic mallets. Higher-quality children's sets use rubberwood or hardwood with water-based dyes, designed to withstand outdoor use and rougher handling.

The simplified "animal croquet" sets from toy manufacturers (PlanToys, Manhattan Toy, Tender Leaf Toys) are quite different from standard croquet. They have fewer pieces, smaller courses, and are designed for indoor play as well as outdoor. These work better for the youngest players but do not scale up to the full game.

Croquet requires a relatively flat, mowed grass surface to play properly. Bumpy or overgrown lawns make the game frustrating since balls roll unpredictably. This practical requirement limits where and when the game can be played.

The game has a notable learning curve for young children: swinging a mallet accurately takes practice, and understanding the sequencing rules adds cognitive complexity. Many families report that children under 5 enjoy the physical activity of hitting balls but do not engage with the competitive game structure until later.

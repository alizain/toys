Crayons are sticks of pigmented wax used for drawing and coloring on paper. They consist of paraffin wax mixed with color pigments, molded into cylindrical sticks typically around 3.5 inches long. Crayons are one of the most common art supplies given to young children due to their non-toxic composition, blunt tips, and ease of use.

## What It Is

A crayon is a solid drawing instrument made primarily from paraffin wax blended with powdered color pigments. The wax mixture is heated, poured into molds, and allowed to cool and solidify. The resulting stick deposits color when pressed and dragged across paper, leaving a waxy, slightly translucent mark.

Standard crayons measure approximately 3.5 inches in length and have a diameter suitable for gripping. Jumbo crayons are larger and thicker, designed for smaller hands that lack fine motor control. Triangular crayons have a three-sided shape that prevents rolling and encourages proper grip development. Twistable crayons house the wax inside a plastic barrel that can be twisted to extend more crayon as it wears down.

Beyond standard wax crayons, variations include beeswax crayons (made with natural beeswax instead of paraffin), soy crayons (made from soybean oil), gel crayons (with a smoother, creamier consistency), and oil pastels (softer and more blendable than standard crayons). Specialty versions include metallic crayons, washable crayons, fabric crayons for transferring designs onto cloth, and multicultural crayon sets with a range of skin tone colors.

Crayons come in sets ranging from 8 basic colors to boxes containing 64, 96, or even 120 distinct shades. Crayola is the dominant brand in the United States, holding approximately 80% of the market. Other manufacturers include Rose Art, Dixon Ticonderoga, Prang, and Faber-Castell.

## How Kids Play

Children typically begin using crayons between 12 and 18 months of age. At this stage, toddlers hold crayons in a fist grip and make uncontrolled scribbles, using their whole arm to move the crayon across paper. The marks are spontaneous and exploratory rather than representational.

Around age two, children transition from random to controlled scribbling. They begin making intentional circular motions and back-and-forth lines. Their grip gradually evolves from a full fist to an early pencil grasp.

By ages three to four, children start drawing recognizable shapes and their first representations of people, often depicted as "tadpole" figures with a head and legs. They rest their arm on the table and begin using the smaller muscles in their hand for more controlled movements.

At age five and beyond, children demonstrate good control over crayons and begin drawing with intention, depicting scenes, objects, and experiences from their lives. They select colors deliberately and may spend extended periods working on detailed drawings.

Common activities with crayons include freeform drawing, coloring within the lines of coloring books, tracing, rubbings (placing paper over textured surfaces and rubbing with a crayon to transfer the pattern), and simple art projects. Children often sort crayons by color, peel the paper wrappers, or break crayons into smaller pieces during play.

## Notes

Crayons occupy a particular space among children's art supplies. They are less messy than paint or markers, do not dry out if left uncapped, and the blunt tips eliminate concerns about sharp points. The waxy texture means marks can be somewhat difficult to erase but also resist smudging once applied.

Broken crayons remain functional, which extends their usable life. Many families accumulate large collections of crayon fragments over time. Some organizations collect and recycle old crayons, melting them down to create new ones.

The experience of using crayons changes with the quality of both the crayon and the paper. Crayons glide more smoothly on thicker, toothier paper. Higher-quality crayons tend to deposit color more evenly with less wax buildup and flaking.

For very young children, jumbo or triangular crayons are often recommended over standard sizes. The larger diameter accommodates developing grip patterns, and the increased size makes the crayons harder to break and less of a choking hazard.

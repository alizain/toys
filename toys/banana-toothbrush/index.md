The Baby Banana Infant Toothbrush is a flexible silicone teether and training toothbrush designed for infants and young toddlers. Shaped like a peeled banana with two curved handles resembling banana peels, it serves the dual purpose of soothing teething discomfort and introducing early oral hygiene habits. The product was invented by a dental hygienist and mother after witnessing injuries from rigid infant toothbrushes.

## What It Is

The Baby Banana is a single-piece teether and toothbrush made entirely from food grade silicone. The central shaft features soft bristle-like nubs that function as both a gum massager and a basic toothbrush. Two curved extensions on either side act as handles and also prevent the brush from being inserted too deeply into the mouth. The overall dimensions are approximately 4.33 inches by 7.87 inches.

The silicone construction makes the entire object bendable and flexible. There are no hard components, removable parts, or internal mechanisms. The material is BPA-free, phthalate-free, and latex-free. Because it is made from a single piece of silicone, there are no seams or joints where moisture or bacteria could accumulate.

The product is manufactured in the United States and has been available since 2001. Several color variations exist, including yellow, blue, and pink, though the shape and material remain consistent across versions.

## How Kids Play

Infants typically grasp the curved handles and bring the bristled end to their mouths. The wide handle design makes it accessible for babies who are still developing fine motor control, and the curved shape naturally orients the bristled portion toward the mouth.

Children primarily use this as a chew toy during teething. They bite down on the soft bristles and handles, which provides counter-pressure against sore gums. The silicone can be chilled in a freezer beforehand, which adds a cooling sensation that some infants find soothing during active teething periods.

As a training toothbrush, caregivers can guide infants through basic brushing motions, helping them become accustomed to having a brush-like object in their mouth before transitioning to actual toothbrushes. Some children will independently move the bristled portion across their gums and emerging teeth, though deliberate brushing behavior is not expected at this age.

Sessions typically last 5 to 10 minutes of intermittent chewing and mouthing. Many families incorporate it into daily routines, using it during designated teething times or as part of a bedtime oral care introduction.

## Notes

The flexible construction was specifically designed to reduce injury risk. If a child falls or bites down hard while using the product, the silicone bends rather than causing puncture wounds to the mouth or throat. This addresses a documented safety concern with rigid plastic infant toothbrushes.

Cleaning is straightforward. The silicone material is dishwasher-safe and can also be placed in a bottle sterilizer. For daily maintenance, rinsing under warm water is sufficient.

The banana peel handles can be clipped to a pacifier strap, which prevents the teether from falling to the ground when used outside the home.

While marketed as a toothbrush, pediatric dentists generally consider this product more of a teether with oral hygiene familiarization benefits. Actual tooth cleaning for infants is typically accomplished with a damp cloth or finger brush until a child has enough teeth and coordination for supervised brushing with toothpaste.

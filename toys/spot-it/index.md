Spot It! is a pattern-matching card game published by Asmodee (sold as Dobble in Europe). The game uses a mathematically designed deck where any two cards share exactly one matching symbol. Players compete to identify the shared symbol before others do.

## What It Is

The game consists of 55 circular cards, each printed with 8 different symbols. The symbols include common objects, shapes, and images rendered in various colors. The same symbol appears at different sizes across different cards. Cards are made of coated cardstock and typically packaged in a round metal tin or cardboard container. The deck uses 57 distinct symbols total, drawn from a set that includes items like a snowman, anchor, sun, spider, and similar recognizable images.

## How Kids Play

Players reveal cards simultaneously and scan both cards for the one matching symbol. When a player identifies the match, they call out the symbol name aloud and claim or discard a card depending on the variant being played. The game includes five different mini-games with the same deck: some involve collecting the most cards, others involve getting rid of cards first, and one variant has players passing cards to opponents.

Children often lean forward over the cards, point at symbols as they scan, and call out matches with urgency. Younger players sometimes trace the cards with their fingers while searching. Mixed-age groups can play together, though speed differences become apparent. Some children develop strategies like focusing on specific symbols or scanning in patterns. The game tends to generate repeated play sessions in short bursts.

## Notes

The mathematical principle behind the deck is based on finite projective plane geometry, ensuring every card pair shares exactly one symbol. The game was designed by Denis Blanchot, Jacques Cottereau, Guillaume Gille-Naves, and Igor Polouchine. It was first released in France in 2009 and in North America in 2011 under Blue Orange Games before Asmodee acquired the rights in 2015. Junior versions exist with 30 cards and 6 symbols per card for younger children (ages 4+). The varying symbol sizes across cards adds difficulty since the matching symbol may be large on one card and small on the other.

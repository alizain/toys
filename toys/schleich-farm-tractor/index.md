The Schleich Farm World Tractor with Trailer (model 42608) is an 8-piece farm vehicle playset manufactured by the German toy company Schleich, which has been producing toys since 1935. The set is designed at approximately 1:12 scale and weighs about 2 pounds, with overall dimensions of roughly 22 inches long, 6.5 inches high, and 5.5 inches deep.

## What It Is

The set centers on a green plastic tractor with a functional front-end loader bucket. The tractor's hood opens to reveal the engine compartment, and the farmer figure can be seated in the driver's position. Attached to the tractor is a hinged trailer with an opening rear flap and tilting function for dumping loads. The set includes a farmer figure named Paul, a Goldendoodle dog figure, and three straw bale accessories. All pieces are made from hard plastic with some metal components, designed for durability. The figures and accessories are compatible with other Schleich Farm World products at the same scale.

## How Kids Play

Children push the tractor manually across surfaces, using the front loader to scoop and lift the included straw bales. The bales get loaded into the trailer, then dumped out by tilting the trailer or opening the rear flap. The farmer figure seats in the tractor to "drive" during play scenarios. Children often incorporate the set into larger farm narratives, moving materials between locations or combining with other Schleich Farm World animals and structures. The opening hood invites mechanical role-play where children inspect or pretend to repair the engine. Play sessions frequently involve transporting goods, feeding animals, or general farm work scenarios.

## Notes

The set contains small parts and carries a choking hazard warning for children under 3 years. Assembly is required for the front loader component, with Schleich noting in 2025 that step 4 in older instruction manuals should be skipped as parts have been pre-molded together. The tractor does not have any electronic components or require batteries. Schleich Farm World products maintain consistent scale across the line, allowing pieces from different sets to work together. The Goldendoodle figure is a recent addition to the Farm World line, reflecting Schleich's periodic updates to companion animal options.

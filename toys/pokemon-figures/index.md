Pokemon figures are action figures and collectible toys depicting characters from the Pokemon media franchise. Jazwares currently holds the master toy license for all regions outside Asia, having acquired Wicked Cool Toys in 2019. The line succeeded earlier releases from Jakks Pacific (2007-2017) and Tomy, which continue to circulate in secondary markets.

## What It Is

Pokemon figures are produced in several standardized sizes. The Battle Figure line includes 2-inch, 3-inch, and 4.5-inch scales marketed as "Scaled for Battle," meaning figures within each size category maintain consistent proportions relative to one another based on the characters' in-game heights. The Select line operates outside this scale system and includes 4-inch and 8-inch vinyl figures, 6-inch super-articulated figures, and larger 12-inch "Epic Battle" figures.

Construction varies by product tier. Standard Battle Figures are solid plastic with limited or no articulation, typically featuring a fixed pose. Select Super-Articulated figures offer multiple points of movement at shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and sometimes heads. Vinyl figures are softer and intended primarily for display. Materials across the line include PVC plastic, ABS plastic, and vinyl depending on the specific product.

Accessories and playsets accompany many releases. "Clip 'N' Go" sets pair a figure with a Poke Ball case that clips to a separate belt accessory. Environment packs recreate locations from the games and anime. Battle Feature figures include action mechanisms such as chomping jaws or launching projectiles that reference specific Pokemon moves.

The figure roster spans all nine generations of Pokemon, from original characters like Pikachu, Charizard, and Bulbasaur through recent additions like Armarouge and Annihilape. The line includes both common species and rare or legendary Pokemon, as well as shiny variants and evolution sets.

## How Kids Play

Children use Pokemon figures to stage battles between characters, recreating combat scenarios from the video games, trading card game, and animated series. A typical play pattern involves selecting opposing Pokemon, positioning them facing each other, and narrating or acting out attack sequences. Children often assign move names and damage during these encounters, drawing on knowledge from other Pokemon media.

Collection and organization represent a distinct play mode. Children sort figures by type (fire, water, grass), by evolution family, by region of origin, or by personal favorites. This sorting activity connects to the "catch them all" collection dynamic central to the broader franchise. Display arrangements on shelves or in cases serve both as storage and as a form of continued engagement with the collection.

Figures integrate with broader Pokemon play ecosystems. Children use them alongside trading cards, video games, and the animated series, moving between media while maintaining consistent character relationships. Figures often accompany children during car rides, visits, or travel as portable play objects.

Social play occurs when children bring figures together for shared battles or trading. Negotiations around trades and battle rules constitute part of the play experience. Some children develop ongoing storylines or "teams" that persist across multiple play sessions.

## Notes

The "Scaled for Battle" system means a 2-inch Pikachu and 2-inch Charmander reflect their relative sizes in the games, but the Select and Epic lines use different scales for display purposes. Mixing figures from different lines in battle play may create visual inconsistencies.

Articulation varies widely across the product line. Budget 2-inch figures are typically static, while 6-inch Select figures offer substantial poseability. Parents and gift-givers sometimes expect articulation that the smaller figures do not provide.

The figure line updates to include new Pokemon as games release. Characters from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet began appearing in 2023 and 2024 waves. Some popular characters see multiple releases across different scales and product tiers.

Jazwares releases figures through mass retailers (Target, Walmart, GameStop) as well as through their direct shop. Certain figures are retailer exclusives or limited releases through the Jazwares Vault program. Holiday calendars offer 13-day or 24-day assortments of smaller figures and accessories.

Earlier Pokemon figures from Jakks Pacific (2007-2017) used different scale standards and construction. These remain available through secondary markets and are not directly compatible with current Jazwares scaling.

Razor electric scooters are battery-powered standing scooters designed for children and young teenagers. The product line includes several models with varying specifications, including the E100, E200, Power Core E90, and Power Core S85. These scooters have been manufactured since the early 2000s and remain widely available at retail stores.

## What It Is

A Razor electric scooter consists of a steel frame with a flat standing platform (the deck), a vertical steering column with handlebars, and two wheels. The deck is typically aluminum with a textured grip surface where the rider stands. A rechargeable sealed lead-acid battery housed within the deck powers an electric motor that drives the rear wheel.

The handlebars feature a twist-grip throttle on one side and a hand-operated brake lever on the other. Entry-level models like the E100 have a 100-watt motor and reach speeds up to 10 mph, while larger models like the E200 use a 200-watt motor with speeds up to 12 mph. The front tire is typically pneumatic (air-filled), while rear tire construction varies by model.

Weight limits range from 120 pounds on the E100 to 154 pounds on the E200. The scooters themselves weigh between 14 and 26 pounds depending on the model. Battery charge time is approximately 12 hours, and ride time on a full charge ranges from 35 to 70 minutes depending on the model.

## How Kids Play

Children typically ride these scooters on sidewalks, driveways, cul-de-sacs, and paved paths in parks. The motor requires a kick-start to engage, meaning the rider must push off and reach approximately 3 mph before the electric motor activates. This design prevents sudden starts from a standstill.

Riders stand with both feet on the deck, grip the handlebars, and twist the throttle to accelerate. Steering is accomplished by turning the handlebars. Stopping involves releasing the throttle and squeezing the hand brake. Children often ride in circuits around their immediate neighborhood or back and forth along a stretch of sidewalk.

The 40-minute battery life on most models creates natural session lengths. Groups of children sometimes take turns on a single scooter while the others ride kick scooters or bicycles alongside. Some children use them for transportation to nearby destinations like a friend's house or local park.

## Notes

The kick-start motor activation is a deliberate safety feature that prevents the scooter from lurching forward when stationary. Children accustomed to kick scooters typically adapt to this quickly.

The motor housing on some models sits low to the ground and can scrape pavement during sharp turns. This is particularly noticeable when making tight right-hand turns.

Battery performance degrades over time and with improper charging habits. The sealed lead-acid batteries should be charged after each use and not left in a discharged state for extended periods.

The 12-hour charge time means the scooter typically needs to be plugged in overnight between riding sessions. Children who want extended ride time sometimes find this limiting.

Entry-level models like the E100 are sized specifically for younger riders, with a lower deck height and narrower handlebars than adult models. Children on the upper end of the weight limit or age range often transition to larger models like the E200 or E300.

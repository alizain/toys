The Oball Classic is a 4-inch diameter ball with an open lattice structure featuring 32 finger holes. Manufactured by Kids2 under the Bright Starts brand, the toy was first introduced over 25 years ago and acquired by Kids II in 2011. Over 8 million units have been sold worldwide.

## What It Is

The ball consists of a flexible plastic mesh formed into a sphere. The construction creates 32 openings distributed across the surface, each large enough for infant fingers to pass through. The material is soft and pliable, allowing the ball to compress when squeezed and return to its original shape. Standard color options include red, blue, green, and yellow sections, though pink and purple variants exist. The ball weighs very little and has no internal components, rattles, or batteries. It can be wiped clean with a damp cloth.

## How Kids Play

Newborns grasp the ball by inserting fingers into the holes, which accommodates the palmar grasp reflex present from birth. The lightweight construction and multiple grip points allow infants to hold and lift the ball earlier than they could manage a solid ball of similar size. Infants shake it, mouth it, and pass it between hands. During tummy time, rolling the ball slowly in front of the baby encourages reaching and head lifting. Older babies roll the ball back and forth with a caregiver, chase it while crawling, and begin throwing it. The flexible material makes it safe for indoor throwing. Toddlers often chew on the lattice during teething, as the material is soft enough for sore gums.

## Notes

The 32-hole design means babies do not need a developed pincer grasp to hold the ball. They can grip it using whole-hand movements from the earliest weeks. The ball springs back after being compressed or stepped on. Because it has no moving parts or electronics, there is nothing to break or require batteries. The open structure means it does not roll as far or as fast as a solid ball, which can be useful for babies who cannot yet chase quickly. The mesh construction also means it floats and drains water, making it usable in the bath.

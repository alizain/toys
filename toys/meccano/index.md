Meccano is a construction toy system invented in 1898 by Frank Hornby in Liverpool, England. The system uses perforated metal strips, plates, and girders that connect with nuts and bolts, allowing builders to create mechanical models and structures. In the United States, a similar product called the Erector Set was introduced in 1913; the two brands merged in 2000 and are now sold under the Meccano name.

## What It Is

Meccano sets contain metal strips and plates with uniformly spaced holes (4mm holes at half-inch intervals), enabling parts to be combined in numerous configurations. Standard sets include angle girders, flat strips, perforated plates, wheels, axles, gears, pulleys, spacers, and the nuts and bolts needed to fasten pieces together. Many sets include real tools (wrenches and screwdrivers) sized for the hardware. Some sets contain electric motors, allowing built models to move. The Meccano Junior line, designed for younger children, uses larger plastic pieces with finger-safe connectors rather than the traditional metal components with small hardware.

## How Kids Play

Children follow included instruction booklets to build specific models such as vehicles, cranes, bridges, or robots. Once familiar with the parts, many builders create their own designs, experimenting with different structural arrangements. The construction process involves measuring alignment, threading bolts through holes, and tightening nuts with tools. Builders often disassemble completed models to reuse parts for new projects. With sets containing motors, children construct machines that move, turn, or lift objects. The modular nature of the system means parts from different sets can be combined, and older models remain compatible with newer pieces.

## Notes

The standard hole spacing has remained consistent since the early 1900s, which means vintage Meccano parts can still connect with contemporary sets. Building with Meccano requires manual dexterity and patience, particularly when aligning multiple holes or working in tight spaces within a model. The metal construction produces structures with a mechanical, industrial appearance distinct from plastic building toys. Assembly times vary widely based on model complexity, from simple builds taking under an hour to advanced sets requiring multiple sessions to complete.

Trouble is a race-style board game first released in 1965 by Kohner Brothers and later manufactured by Milton Bradley (now Hasbro). The game is a simplified variant of Pachisi. It is known in the UK as Frustration and in Finland as Kimble.

## What It Is

The game consists of a molded plastic board with a raised track of spaces forming a loop around the perimeter. At the center sits the Pop-O-Matic, a clear plastic dome containing a single six-sided die mounted over a flexible sheet. Pressing the dome flexes this sheet and causes the die to tumble, producing a distinctive popping sound. The board includes four corner sections, each with a colored home area and finish zone. The game comes with 16 plastic pegs in four colors (four pegs per player). Four rubber feet on the underside keep the board stable during play.

## How Kids Play

Players take turns pressing the Pop-O-Matic dome to roll the die. A player must roll a six to move a peg from their home area onto the starting space. Once on the board, pegs move clockwise around the track according to the number rolled. Rolling a six grants an additional turn. If a peg lands on a space occupied by an opponent's peg, the opponent's peg returns to their home area. Players work to move all four of their pegs around the board and into their finish zone. The contained die mechanism means turns proceed quickly since there is no loose die to retrieve. Games typically last around 45 minutes with 2 to 4 players.

## Notes

The Pop-O-Matic mechanism was patented and became the defining feature of the game. Because the die is enclosed, it cannot be lost and rolling cannot be manipulated. The popping sound is a consistent part of the play experience. The game requires counting spaces and basic turn-taking. Younger children sometimes press the Pop-O-Matic repeatedly for the sound and sensation rather than for game purposes.

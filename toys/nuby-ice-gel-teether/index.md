The Nuby Ice Gel Teether Keys is a teething toy designed for infants beginning around three months of age. It consists of multiple key-shaped pieces attached to a central ring, combining a graspable toy with surfaces intended for chewing. The product is marketed under the "IcyBite" line by Nuby.

## What It Is

The teether measures approximately 5.5 inches tall by 2.5 inches wide. It features several colorful key shapes connected to a plastic ring that serves as a handle. Each key has two distinct zones: a textured upper portion made of soft material with raised, offset surfaces, and a lower portion containing PurICE gel that can be refrigerated. The gel-filled sections are designed to stay cold longer than water-filled alternatives. The colors are bright and varied across the different key shapes. The ring portion provides a grip point sized for small hands.

## How Kids Play

Infants grasp the ring handle or individual keys and bring the toy to their mouths. They chew on different surfaces of the keys, rotating between the textured upper portions and the smoother gel-filled lower sections. When refrigerated beforehand, the cooled gel sections receive sustained attention. Children often shake the toy, creating movement they can watch. The ring design allows for passing the toy between hands. Older infants may explore the different colors and textures visually and tactilely before mouthing.

## Notes

The product cannot be sterilized and requires spot or wipe cleaning only. The gel remains inside sealed compartments rather than being removable. The manufacturer specifies refrigeration rather than freezing for the cooling function. Various color combinations exist, including neutral palettes and brighter multi-color versions. The textured portions show visible raised bumps and ridges at different heights across the key surfaces.

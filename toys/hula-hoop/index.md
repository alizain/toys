The hula hoop is a lightweight ring spun around the body through rhythmic hip movements. Hoops have been used for play since at least 500 BC, with early versions made from dried grapevines, willow, and rattan. The modern plastic hula hoop emerged in 1958 when Wham-O commercialized the toy using newly developed Marlex plastic.

## What It Is

A hula hoop consists of a hollow plastic tube formed into a circle and joined with an internal dowel insert secured by staples. Children's hoops typically measure 70 centimeters (28 inches) in diameter, while adult hoops range from 100 to 110 centimeters (39-42 inches). The tube is made from high-density polyethylene, often colored with pigments or decorated with stripes and glitter. Some hoops contain loose ball bearings, beads, or bells inside the hollow tube that create sound during rotation. A paper label covers the joint where the ends meet.

## How Kids Play

Children keep the hoop spinning by swiveling their hips in a continuous circular motion while the hoop rotates around their waist. Players also spin hoops around their arms, legs, and neck. Beyond body-spinning, children roll hoops along the ground and chase them, toss hoops like rings onto targets, lay hoops flat as boundaries for jumping games, and hold them upright as tunnels to walk or crawl through. Younger children often step inside hoops placed on the ground, lift them overhead, or use them as stationary play boundaries before developing the coordination needed for sustained spinning. Group games include passing hoops while holding hands in a circle and relay races requiring hoop transport.

## Notes

The name references the Hawaiian hula dance, though the toy has no actual connection to Hawaii. Wham-O sold 25 million hoops within the first four months of production. The toy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1999. Japanese officials banned public hula hooping in the 1950s, believing it incited impropriety. Many contemporary users make their own hoops from PVC piping or polypropylene tubing.

Playmobil Airport sets are themed playsets within the City Action line that replicate commercial airport operations. The flagship set (71153) includes a terminal building, control tower, and passenger airplane with approximately 146 pieces. These sets have been part of the Playmobil catalog since the 1980s, with various iterations released over the decades.

## What It Is

A Playmobil Airport set typically consists of a multi-section terminal building with check-in counter, security checkpoint, and departure area. The control tower attaches to or sits alongside the terminal and features control panels and large windows. The airplane component has a detachable roof to allow access to the interior, 360-degree swiveling wheels, and opening doors. Sets include multiple 7.5cm Playmobil figures representing pilots, flight attendants, passengers, and ground crew. Accessories such as luggage, trolleys, X-ray machines, conveyor belts, cameras, monitors, and destination boards round out the scene. The terminal measures approximately 46.5 x 23 x 18.5 cm, and the airplane measures approximately 41 x 44 x 15 cm in the current main set.

## How Kids Play

Children guide passenger figures through the airport sequence: checking in at the counter, placing luggage on the conveyor belt, passing through the security checkpoint and metal detector, and proceeding to the boarding gate. At the control tower, figures operate simulated control panels, microphones, and monitors to direct air traffic. The destination board can be adjusted to announce arrivals and departures. The airplane's removable roof allows children to seat passengers inside, while the pilot figure takes position in the cockpit. Ground crew figures handle luggage loading and aircraft preparation. Play often involves creating departure and arrival scenarios, weather delays, or coordinating multiple flights. The conveyor belt moves luggage manually from check-in toward the aircraft. Security screening with the X-ray machine and metal detector provides opportunities for procedural role-play.

## Notes

Assembly time with adult assistance is approximately 45 minutes for the main set. The sets require moderate cleanup effort as the terminal structure stays assembled but smaller accessories and figures need organizing. Playmobil has released airport add-on sets over the years including aircraft stairs with cargo loader, airport fire engines, and passenger shuttle buses. A toddler version exists in the Playmobil 1.2.3 Junior line (Airport Shuttle Bus) for ages 1-4, made with over 90% bio-based plastic. The standard City Action airport sets use traditional ABS plastic. Earlier versions of the airport set (such as 5338, released 2016-2018) included similar components with slight variations in design and accessories.

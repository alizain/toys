Ticket to Ride: First Journey is an introductory train route-building board game designed by Alan R. Moon and published by Days of Wonder. It adapts the mechanics of the original Ticket to Ride series for a younger audience, with simplified rules and a shorter play time of 15-30 minutes. The game accommodates 2-4 players.

## What It Is

The game includes a folded cardboard game board (72x48cm) depicting a simplified map of the United States with 20 cities connected by colored routes. Players receive 80 plastic train pieces divided among four colors, with 22 trains per player color. The trains are slightly larger than those in the original Ticket to Ride game and show molded detail. The card components consist of 72 train cards in six colors plus rainbow "engine" cards, 32 ticket cards showing city pairs to connect, 4 Coast-to-Coast bonus ticket cards, and 1 Golden Ticket card. All cards are printed on heavy cardstock at 56x87mm size.

## How Kids Play

Children draw train cards from the deck on their turn, collecting sets of matching colors. When they have enough cards matching a route's color and length, they place their plastic trains on that route and discard the cards. Routes on this map require fewer trains than the original game, typically 1-4 pieces. Players work to connect the two cities shown on their ticket cards by claiming adjacent routes between them. Completing a ticket lets a player draw a new one. If a player connects a West Coast city to an East Coast city with a continuous path of their trains, they claim a Coast-to-Coast bonus ticket. The first player to complete six tickets takes the Golden Ticket and wins. Alternatively, if a player places their last train, the game ends and whoever has completed the most tickets wins.

## Notes

The game requires color recognition, basic counting, and the ability to identify city names and trace paths on the map. Most children at the target age can play without adult assistance once they understand the rules. The turn structure is straightforward: draw cards, claim a route, or exchange tickets. Unlike the original Ticket to Ride, players draw cards directly from the deck rather than choosing from face-up options, which increases the luck element. There is no point scoring system; victory is determined solely by completing tickets. The Coast-to-Coast bonus provides an alternative path to accumulating completed tickets. Players can discard unsatisfactory ticket cards and draw new ones without penalty, unlike the original game.

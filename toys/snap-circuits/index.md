Snap Circuits is an electronics construction kit manufactured by Elenco. Children build working electrical circuits by connecting color-coded plastic modules on a transparent base grid. The components use metal snaps rather than wires or solder, making electrical connections that can be assembled and disassembled repeatedly.

## What It Is

The kit consists of plastic modules mounted with electronic components and metal snap connectors. A clear plastic base grid with rows and columns (typically labeled A-G and 1-10) provides the building surface where modules attach to evenly spaced posts. Components include snap wires, resistors, capacitors, switches, LEDs, motors, speakers, integrated circuits, and a photoresistor, among others. Each piece is numbered and color-coded for identification. Kits range from beginner sets with approximately 30 parts to larger sets with 60-80+ components. Batteries provide power but are typically not included.

## How Kids Play

Children follow illustrated project manuals that show exact placement of components on the grid. Projects progress in complexity, starting with simple circuits like a lamp or switch, advancing to AM radios, alarm systems, voice-controlled lamps, and electronic games. The snap mechanism allows quick assembly and disassembly, so children can complete a project, observe it functioning, then take it apart and build something different. Some children follow the manual sequentially; others flip through looking for projects that interest them. Once familiar with the components, children sometimes experiment with their own circuit designs outside the manual instructions.

## Notes

The snap connections are secure enough to hold circuits together during use but release with moderate pulling force. Younger children may initially need guidance reading the diagrams and matching numbered components. The transparent base grid allows printed diagrams to be placed underneath as a building template. Components store neatly by snapping them onto the base grid when not in use. A beginner version exists for ages 5-9 with simpler projects and more pictorial instructions.

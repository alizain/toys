Cubetto is a screen-free coding toy consisting of a wooden robot, a programming board, and colored instruction blocks. Developed by Primo Toys, it teaches basic programming concepts through tactile, hands-on play. The system is designed for children who have not yet learned to read or write.

## What It Is

The Cubetto playset contains three main components: the robot itself, an interface board, and 16 coding blocks.

The robot is a cube-shaped wooden figure made from linden plywood with ABS plastic components. It has a simple smiling face carved or printed on the front. The robot moves on two wheels and requires three AA batteries.

The interface board is a rectangular panel with a grid of slots where children place the coding blocks. It has a prominent blue button that executes the program. The board also requires three AA batteries and communicates with the robot via Bluetooth.

The coding blocks come in four colors, each representing a different command:
- Green blocks move the robot forward 15 centimeters
- Yellow blocks turn the robot left 90 degrees
- Red blocks turn the robot right 90 degrees
- Blue blocks (function blocks) execute a subroutine from a separate row on the board

The playset includes a 1x1 meter fabric world map printed with a grid of squares matching the robot's movement distance, along with an accompanying storybook with activities.

Expansion packs add themed maps (ocean, city, Egypt, space) with corresponding storybooks. Additional block sets introduce new commands including random blocks (black), negation blocks (cream), and backward blocks.

## How Kids Play

Children place the colored blocks into slots on the interface board to create a sequence of commands. When they press the blue button, the robot executes the instructions in order, moving across the map. If the robot does not reach the intended destination, children can swap or rearrange blocks and try again.

A typical activity involves navigating the robot from one location on the map to another, following prompts from the storybook. Children must visualize the path and translate it into a sequence of forward, left, and right commands.

The function line at the bottom of the board introduces subroutines. Children can place a sequence of blocks in this row, then use the blue function block in the main program to call that sequence. This allows for creating reusable command patterns.

Younger children (around age 3-4) typically work with simple sequences of 2-4 blocks, focusing on understanding that each block causes a specific action. Older children (5-6) can work with longer sequences and begin using the function blocks to create more complex programs.

The toy supports both solo play and collaborative use. In classroom settings, children often work in pairs or small groups, discussing strategies and taking turns placing blocks and pressing the button.

## Notes

The wooden construction and absence of screens distinguish Cubetto from many other coding toys. The tactile nature of placing physical blocks into slots provides a direct, manipulable representation of programming that does not require literacy.

The movement distance of 15 centimeters per forward block matches the grid squares on the maps, creating a predictable relationship between commands and outcomes. This consistency helps children predict and verify their programs.

The function block introduces the concept of abstraction at a basic level. A sequence of commands can be named (placed in the function row) and reused, which mirrors how functions work in actual programming.

Primo Toys was founded in London and ran a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2016. The company describes the design as Montessori-approved and inspired by Logo Turtle, an earlier educational programming environment.

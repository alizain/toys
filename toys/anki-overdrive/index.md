Anki Overdrive is an app-controlled robotic racing system that combines physical toy cars with artificial intelligence and smartphone gameplay. Released in 2015, it features small autonomous cars that race on modular magnetic track pieces while players control speed, steering, and virtual weapons through a mobile app.

## What It Is

The system consists of small robotic cars (approximately 4 inches long) called Supercars and larger vehicles called Supertrucks. Each car contains an onboard computer, infrared camera, and motors that allow it to scan and navigate the track autonomously. The cars are made of plastic with rubber tires.

The track pieces are thin, flexible vinyl sheets with a glossy black surface and magnetic connectors on each end. The magnetic system allows pieces to snap together quickly and hold firmly during play. Track configurations include straight pieces, 90-degree curves, intersections, bank turns, elevation risers, and jump pieces. A starter kit typically includes 10-12 track pieces that can form up to 8 different layouts, with expansion packs available to create larger and more complex courses.

The system requires a four-car charging platform that connects via USB. Cars charge in approximately 8-10 minutes and run on internal batteries. A smartphone or tablet running the Anki Overdrive app (iOS or Android) is required to play.

Several editions were produced: the original Overdrive Starter Kit (with cars named Skull and GroundShock), the Fast & Furious Edition (featuring Dom's Ice Charger and Hobbs' MXT), and various expansion Supercars and Supertrucks that added different vehicle characteristics and abilities.

## How Kids Play

Players download the app, charge the cars, and assemble a track by snapping the magnetic pieces together. Before racing, cars take preliminary laps around the course, using their infrared cameras to scan and map the track layout.

During gameplay, players tilt their device to change lanes and use an on-screen throttle to control speed. The game includes virtual weapons (lasers, tractor beams, and other power-ups) that players can fire at opponents through the app, similar to Mario Kart-style racing games. When a car takes enough virtual damage, it slows down or spins out on the physical track.

The system supports both competitive multiplayer (up to 4 players with additional cars) and single-player modes against AI opponents. The app includes a campaign mode with AI characters that have distinct driving styles and attack patterns. Players can upgrade their virtual weapons and unlock new abilities through continued play.

Younger children (ages 6-7) can participate with adult assistance, while the recommended age of 8+ reflects the complexity of app controls and game mechanics. The system appeals to teenagers and adults as well, often becoming a multi-generational activity. Track building itself is accessible to younger children due to the simple magnetic connections, and the flexible track material allows for 3D configurations using household items as elevation supports.

## Notes

Anki, the San Francisco-based robotics company that created Overdrive, shut down in April 2019 after failing to secure additional funding despite having raised over $180 million in venture capital. The company's assets were acquired by Digital Dream Labs in December 2019.

Official support for Anki Overdrive ended on October 15, 2021. The apps required to operate the system have been removed from app stores, which means new users cannot download the software needed to play. Existing owners who still have the app installed can continue using their systems, but the product is effectively discontinued for new purchasers.

The original Anki Drive (2013) used fixed vinyl mats rather than modular pieces. Overdrive's magnetic modular system was the key innovation that distinguished the second generation product and allowed for varied track configurations.

The cars contain sophisticated positioning technology that reads coded patterns printed in the track surface, allowing them to know their precise location and maintain lane positioning without physical guide rails (unlike traditional slot cars).

Operation is a battery-operated dexterity game first released by Milton Bradley in 1965 and currently produced by Hasbro. The game was originally designed by John Spinello, a University of Illinois industrial design student, who created the prototype in 1964. The core mechanic involves using tweezers to extract small plastic pieces from recessed openings without triggering an electric circuit.

## What It Is

The game consists of a cardboard gameboard printed with a cartoon illustration of a patient nicknamed "Cavity Sam," depicted lying on an operating table. Sam has a red plastic light-up nose and multiple cavity openings cut into the board at various body locations. Each opening is lined with conductive metal edges and contains a removable plastic piece representing a humorous ailment. The pieces include items such as a wishbone (in the chest), a charley horse (in the leg), butterflies (in the stomach), a funny bone (in the elbow), water on the knee, an adam's apple (in the throat), spare ribs, a broken heart, writer's cramp, wrenched ankle, and a bread basket. The game includes a pair of metal tweezers connected to the board by a wire, a set of doctor cards, and play money.

## How Kids Play

Players draw doctor cards that specify which ailment to remove and how much money that operation is worth. Using the metal tweezers, a player attempts to extract the named plastic piece from its cavity. If the tweezers touch the metal edge of the opening during extraction, an electrical circuit closes, causing Sam's nose to light up red and a buzzer to sound. When this happens, the player's turn ends and they do not collect the money for that operation. If the player successfully removes the piece without triggering the buzzer, they collect the designated amount. Players take turns attempting operations, and the player who accumulates the most money wins. The game can also be played solo as a dexterity exercise.

## Notes

The game requires a steady hand and tests fine motor control. The varying sizes and shapes of the cavity openings create different difficulty levels; some pieces sit in larger, more accessible openings while others require more precise maneuvering. The buzzer provides immediate auditory and visual feedback. The humorous ailment names and cartoon patient create a lighthearted framing for what is essentially a test of hand-eye coordination. Over the years, Hasbro has released themed versions featuring characters from properties like Shrek, The Simpsons, Spider-Man, and Toy Story. The original 1965 version included 12 ailments, and the classic version has maintained a similar format. The game requires adult assembly and uses 2 AA batteries to power the light and buzzer mechanism.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures are poseable figurines based on the anthropomorphic turtle characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984. Playmates Toys has manufactured the majority of TMNT toys since 1988, producing approximately 400 figures and dozens of vehicles and playsets in the original line alone. The franchise remains in active production with figures tied to animated series and film releases.

## What It Is

TMNT action figures are manufactured primarily in the 4 to 4.5-inch scale. The standard figures feature between 7 and 12 points of articulation at the neck, shoulders, wrists, and hips, though premium lines such as the Elite Series offer up to 34 points of articulation. Each of the four turtle characters carries signature weapons: Leonardo wields twin katanas, Donatello carries a bo staff, Raphael uses twin sai, and Michelangelo fights with nunchaku.

Figures typically ship with weapon racks or accessory sets that store in or attach to the turtle shell sculpted on each figure's back. The product lines span the four main turtle characters along with allies such as Splinter, April O'Neil, and Casey Jones, as well as villains including Shredder, Bebop, Rocksteady, and the Foot Clan soldiers. Playsets have included environments such as the Technodrome, the Sewer Playset, and various vehicles including the Turtle Van and Foot Cruiser.

Current lines include the Mutations Mix 'N Match series, which allows interchangeable heads and limbs between figures, and remastered classic figures featuring updated articulation and sculpting while maintaining the aesthetic of the 1980s animated series.

## How Kids Play

Children stage battles between turtle figures and villain characters, positioning them in combat poses using the articulated joints. The weapons accessories are central to play, with kids outfitting figures before staging confrontations and frequently swapping weapons between characters. Dialogue and sound effects accompany the physical movement of figures through action sequences.

The franchise's ensemble cast encourages group play scenarios. Children commonly assign turtle characters among friends or rotate between playing heroes and villains. The distinct personality traits of each turtle, as established in the source material, provide frameworks for character-based play even without direct media reference.

Vehicles and playsets expand staging possibilities. Figures fit inside vehicle cockpits, and the various Turtle Lair playsets provide multi-level environments for combat scenes. Role play accessories including masks and shell backpacks extend play beyond the figures themselves, allowing children to embody the characters directly.

## Notes

Between 1988 and 1997, TMNT toys generated approximately $1.1 billion in sales, ranking third among action figure properties at that time behind G.I. Joe and Star Wars. Staff artists at Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many figures, vehicles, and playsets, receiving credit on product packaging.

The 40th anniversary in 2024 prompted vintage reissues of classic playsets including the Technodrome, with 2025 releases including the Foot Cruiser and Sewer Playset. These reissues reproduce the original product designs with original-style packaging.

Adult collectors represent a portion of the market, particularly for premium lines and vintage reissues. NECA produces a separate line of 7-inch scale figures oriented toward this demographic, featuring higher detail and articulation than the Playmates mainline products.

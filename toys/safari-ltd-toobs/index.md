Safari Ltd TOOBs are themed collections of miniature figurines packaged in clear plastic tubes. Each set contains between 6 and 13 hand-painted pieces centered on a specific subject, from dinosaurs and ocean life to ancient Egypt and space exploration. The tube packaging includes a latching top and carry handle, functioning as portable storage.

## What It Is

Each TOOB is a cylindrical container measuring approximately 1.5 inches in diameter and 13 inches tall. The figurines inside typically range from 1.25 to 3.75 inches in height. Standard TOOBs retail around $14-16, while larger Super TOOBs cost approximately $24. The figures are made from BPA-free, phthalate-free, and lead-free plastics. Each piece is individually painted by hand, resulting in minor variations between identical figures. The tubes are resealable and the figures can be hand-washed with soapy water or placed on a dishwasher's top rack without heat.

Themes span a broad range: animals (farm, ocean, insects, domestic cats, dogs, pandas), prehistoric creatures (dinosaurs, ancient fossils), geography (continents, habitats like coral reef or Sahara Desert), history (Ancient Rome, Revolutionary War), fantasy (dragons, fairies, mermaids), holidays, and objects (construction vehicles, musical instruments, space exploration).

## How Kids Play

Children incorporate TOOB figures into sensory bins, combining them with sand, rice, water, or pebbles for exploratory play. The small scale makes them suitable for sorting and matching activities, where children group figures by type, size, or habitat. In Montessori settings, educators use TOOBs with nomenclature cards for vocabulary work and three-period lessons.

The figures appear in small world play, placed into dioramas, block constructions, or natural settings built from sticks, rocks, and fabric. Children create narrative scenarios, populating scenes with multiple figures and acting out stories. The portability of the tube container means the sets travel to grandparents' houses, waiting rooms, and restaurants.

Therapists use the figures in speech and play therapy contexts as prompts for conversation and expression. The size requires pincer grip to manipulate, engaging fine motor skills.

## Notes

Individual figurines cannot be purchased separately from Safari Ltd; each piece is unique to its set. Paleontologists and zoologists have contributed to the design of some animal and prehistoric figures. The figures are flexible plastic and can be gently reshaped by hand if bent out of shape. Designer TOOBs are slightly smaller containers (1.75 x 1.75 x 10.5 inches) with fewer pieces than standard TOOBs.

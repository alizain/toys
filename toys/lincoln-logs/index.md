Lincoln Logs are a construction toy consisting of miniature notched wooden logs that interlock to form structures. Invented around 1916 by John Lloyd Wright (son of architect Frank Lloyd Wright), the toy was inspired by the interlocking beam foundation of Tokyo's Imperial Hotel. The logs are named after Abraham Lincoln, who lived in a log cabin.

## What It Is

Lincoln Logs are small wooden cylinders, approximately three-quarters of an inch in diameter, with notches cut near each end. The notches allow logs to be laid perpendicular to one another, stacking to form rectangular walls. Sets include logs of varying lengths, plus flat roof slabs, chimney pieces, and door and window frames. Some sets contain plastic figures of people and animals scaled to the buildings. The logs were originally made from redwood but are now typically manufactured from maple wood, which resists splintering.

## How Kids Play

Children stack the logs horizontally, fitting the notches together at corners to build walls. The interlocking design creates structures stable enough to withstand handling. Most sets include instruction sheets showing how to build specific cabins or buildings, though the pieces work for open-ended construction. Younger children (around age 3-4) tend to focus on basic stacking and simple enclosures, while older children build more elaborate multi-room structures, forts, or towns. The pieces are often combined with other small toys and figures for imaginative play scenarios.

## Notes

Lincoln Logs were among the first toys marketed on television during the 1950s, often advertised during Western-themed programming. The toy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1999. Manufacturing has passed through several companies over the decades, including Playskool, Milton Bradley, Hasbro, K'NEX, and currently Basic Fun (since 2017). The brand briefly produced all-plastic sets in the 1970s but returned to wood construction. Current production uses wood sourced partially from FSC-certified forests.

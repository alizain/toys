Connect Four is a two-player strategy game played on a vertical grid where players take turns dropping colored discs into columns, attempting to align four of their pieces in a row. The game combines simple rules with strategic depth, making it accessible to children while remaining engaging for older players. It has been sold under the Connect Four trademark since 1974 and is known by various names including Four in a Row, Captain's Mistress, and Plot Four.

## What It Is

Connect Four consists of a vertically standing plastic grid with seven columns and six rows, creating 42 spaces for game pieces. The grid is held upright by two legs and has open slots at the top for dropping discs. At the bottom, a sliding bar or release mechanism allows all pieces to fall out when the game ends, resetting the board for a new round.

The game comes with 42 discs in two colors, typically 21 red and 21 yellow. These flat, circular checkers are sized to fit precisely into the column slots and stack on top of one another as they fall. The discs are designed to slide smoothly down the columns and rest securely in place once dropped.

Standard tabletop versions measure roughly 10-12 inches across, though the game is available in many sizes. Travel versions fold into compact cases under 10 inches, while giant outdoor versions can reach 3-4 feet in width with proportionally larger discs. Materials range from the standard plastic construction to wooden versions, which are common in giant outdoor sets and artisan editions.

## How Kids Play

Players sit or stand on opposite sides of the grid, each with their own color of discs. They alternate turns, choosing a column and dropping one disc into the top. The disc falls straight down to the lowest available position in that column. Players watch both sides of the transparent grid to see where pieces land.

The objective is to connect four discs of your own color in a continuous line, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Players must simultaneously work toward their own connections while watching for and blocking their opponent's potential winning moves. A game ends when one player achieves four in a row, or when all 42 spaces fill without a winner, resulting in a draw.

Young children often begin by simply enjoying the physical act of dropping discs and watching them fall, practicing fine motor skills and cause-and-effect understanding. Around age 4-5, children start grasping vertical winning lines. By age 6-7, most children understand all winning orientations including diagonals and begin developing blocking strategies.

## Notes

Connect Four was invented by Howard Wexler and Ned Strongin in the early 1970s. Wexler described his inspiration as wanting to create a game played on a vertical plane rather than the horizontal surface typical of most board games. Milton Bradley first released it in February 1974, and the game gained significant popularity after television advertising began in 1979.

The game is mathematically solved, meaning perfect play has been fully analyzed. Researchers determined in 1988 that the first player can always force a win with optimal moves, starting in the center column. This theoretical solution does not diminish casual play, as most games between human players involve enough variation to remain unpredictable.

Several official variations exist. Pop Out allows players to remove one of their own discs from the bottom row, causing all pieces above to shift down. Power Up adds special discs with abilities like removing opponent pieces. A 5-in-a-Row version uses a larger 6-by-9 grid. The basic game remains the most widely played version.

The name "Captain's Mistress" references a legend that Captain James Cook played the game obsessively during his voyages, though historical evidence for this claim is lacking. Regardless of its origins, this alternate name persists in some regions and among wooden game sets marketed as historical reproductions.

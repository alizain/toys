# Session Summary: 1b90b2bc-7e69-4265-88bc-1b6803c1a9b3

## Session ID
`1b90b2bc-7e69-4265-88bc-1b6803c1a9b3`

## Date/Timestamp
**Started**: 2025-12-25T17:18:52.617Z (December 25, 2025, approximately 5:18 PM UTC)

**Duration**: Less than 1 second (session was immediately interrupted)

## Main Topic
**Subagent orchestration for toy image collection**

The user requested an orchestrator agent pattern to manage multiple subagents. Each subagent would be responsible for finding and downloading 3-7 high-quality, high-resolution images for toys located in `@packages/toys/toys/`, saving them with descriptive filenames, and updating each toy's `index.md` file with the new images.

## What was tried
Nothing was executed. The session was interrupted by the user immediately after the request was made, before any assistant response could be generated.

## What was found/learned
No discoveries were made in this session as no work was performed.

## What was accomplished
Nothing was accomplished. The session contains:
1. A `/clear` command execution
2. The main user request about subagent image collection
3. An immediate `[Request interrupted by user]` message

## Key quotes or thoughts
The user's request contained specific guidance for the agent pattern:
- "one subagent per toy"
- "go slowly, don't spawn more than 1 subagent at a time"
- "if the toy already has enough images, it should quit and end work early"

This suggests the user was thinking about rate limiting and efficiency when designing the multi-agent workflow.

## Open questions
- What toys exist in `packages/toys/toys/`?
- How many images currently exist for each toy?
- What sources should be used for finding images?
- What constitutes "high quality, high resolution" in this context?
- What format should the `index.md` image references take?
- Why was the session interrupted - user change of mind, technical issue, or intentional restart?

## Session Status
**Incomplete/Aborted** - The session was interrupted before any work could begin.

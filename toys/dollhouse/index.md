A dollhouse is a miniature replica of a residential dwelling, scaled down so that children can see into multiple rooms and manipulate small figures and furniture inside. These toys range from simple open-fronted structures to elaborate multi-story houses with detailed interiors. Dollhouses typically come with or accommodate miniature furniture, household accessories, and small dolls or figures that serve as inhabitants.

## What It Is

A dollhouse consists of a structure representing a house, usually with the front or one side open or removable to allow access to the interior rooms. The structure is divided into compartments representing different rooms such as bedrooms, kitchens, living areas, and bathrooms. Most dollhouses stand on a floor or tabletop and range in height from about one to four feet.

The most common scale for children's play dollhouses is 1:18 (two-thirds inch scale), while adult collector dollhouses often use 1:12 scale. Larger 1:6 scale houses accommodate fashion dolls approximately 11-12 inches tall. Materials vary widely: wooden dollhouses may be constructed from plywood, medium-density fiberboard, or solid wood; plastic dollhouses are molded in various colors; and historically, painted sheet metal and lithographed tin were common. Some dollhouses are sold fully assembled and decorated, while others come as kits requiring assembly.

Dollhouse furniture and accessories are typically made from plastic, wood, or fabric. Common furnishings include beds, tables, chairs, sofas, kitchen appliances, bathroom fixtures, and decorative items. Some sets include miniature food, dishes, lamps, rugs, and other household details.

## How Kids Play

Children arrange and rearrange furniture within the dollhouse rooms, positioning pieces to create functional spaces. They place small dolls or figures in different rooms and move them through the house as part of imaginative scenarios. Common play themes include daily routines such as meal preparation, eating, cleaning, bedtime, and waking up.

Children create narratives involving the dollhouse inhabitants, inventing characters with distinct personalities and acting out interactions between them. These stories often reflect situations from the child's own life or observations of family dynamics. Play may involve hosting parties, welcoming visitors, caring for babies, or managing household conflicts.

Younger children (ages 1-3) tend to focus on spatial exploration, opening and closing doors, placing objects in containers, and simple cause-and-effect actions like putting a doll in a bed. As children approach ages 3-5, they begin creating storylines and dialogue between figures. Older children may develop extended narratives over multiple play sessions, with consistent characters and ongoing plots.

Children often play with dollhouses alone, narrating scenarios aloud or silently. Cooperative play with siblings or friends involves negotiating roles, sharing figures and furniture, and collaborating on story development.

## Notes

Dollhouses originated in 16th-century Europe as display cabinets for wealthy adults, showcasing miniature furnishings made from expensive materials. German toymakers adapted the concept for children during the 17th and 18th centuries. Mass production during the Industrial Revolution made dollhouses accessible beyond wealthy families, and by the mid-20th century, inexpensive metal and plastic versions were widely available.

The open structure of a dollhouse allows children to observe and control an entire household simultaneously, which differs from playing inside a real space. This bird's-eye perspective may facilitate understanding of how household activities relate to one another across different rooms.

Dollhouse play involves frequent handling of small objects, which requires fine motor control for positioning furniture and figures precisely within confined spaces. The scale of the objects means children must use pincer grip and careful movements.

The toy has traditionally been marketed toward girls, though the underlying play patterns of domestic scenario-building and narrative creation are not inherently gender-specific. Contemporary dollhouses vary in their styling, with some designed to resemble traditional houses and others featuring modern, whimsical, or fantasy architecture.

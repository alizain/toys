BRIO train sets are wooden railway toys originating from Sweden, where the company was founded in 1884 in the town of Osby. The wooden railway system was first introduced in 1958 and has since become a widely recognized standard in the wooden train toy category. The tracks and trains are manufactured primarily from FSC-certified beech wood, with trains connecting via magnetic couplers. The system is designed as an open-ended play concept where all pieces within the BRIO World line are compatible with one another, allowing layouts to be expanded over time.

## What It Is

A BRIO train set consists of interlocking wooden track pieces and rolling stock including locomotives, passenger cars, and freight wagons. The track pieces are precision-machined from beech wood, measuring approximately 40mm wide and 12mm high. Each track features two grooves that are 6mm wide and 3mm deep, spaced 20mm apart. The tracks connect via a male peg and female socket system, with the male connector measuring 11.5mm on a 7mm neck, fitting into female connectors that range from 15-17mm in diameter.

The system includes various track configurations: straight pieces (the standard A track is 144mm, the D track is 216mm), curved pieces (the E track has a 182mm radius, the E1 curve has a 90mm radius), switches, ascending tracks, bridges, and tunnels. The connectors are intentionally designed with some play in the joint, allowing layouts to stretch slightly and bend without causing derailments.

Trains connect to one another using flat magnetic couplers, which allow cars to be joined in any order and orientation. Some sets include battery-powered locomotives, while others rely entirely on manual pushing. The BRIO World line also includes buildings, figures, vehicles, and accessories that integrate with the railway system.

## How Kids Play

Children build track layouts by connecting the wooden pieces together, then run trains along the routes they have created. The open-ended nature of the system means there is no single correct way to assemble a layout. Children may follow suggested configurations included with sets or design their own arrangements using combinations of straights, curves, switches, ramps, and elevation changes.

Younger children often start with simple oval or figure-eight configurations, pushing trains by hand around the track. As they gain experience, they tend to create more elaborate layouts incorporating bridges, tunnels, stations, and multi-level designs using support pieces. The magnetic couplers allow children to easily connect and disconnect cars, arranging trains of varying lengths and compositions.

Play frequently involves narrative elements: children may create scenarios involving passengers boarding at stations, cargo being loaded and unloaded, or trains navigating through landscapes they have constructed. The compatibility of BRIO with other wooden railway brands (including older Thomas Wooden Railway sets using the standard track system) means that children can combine pieces from multiple sources.

The activity involves spatial reasoning as children work out how to connect tracks into closed loops or branching networks. Fine motor skills are engaged when fitting track pieces together and guiding trains along the rails.

## Notes

- BRIO track dimensions have become a de facto standard in the wooden train toy industry. Many third-party manufacturers produce compatible track and rolling stock, though slight dimensional variations between brands can occasionally cause derailments on tight curves when mixing pieces.

- The company was originally a Swedish family business. Production moved to factories in Guangdong Province, China in 2004. BRIO is now owned by Ravensburger, the German puzzle and game company.

- The My First Railway line is designed for children as young as 18 months and features reversible magnet connections (so trains always connect regardless of orientation) and guiding ramps to help toddlers place trains on the track.

- All BRIO wooden components are made from FSC-certified (FSC-C111262) European beech wood from sustainably managed forests.

- BRIO states that their products undergo over 1,000 safety tests annually and are tested to standards exceeding legal requirements.

- The Thomas Wooden Railway line (originally by Learning Curve, later Mattel/Fisher-Price) used a compatible track system for many years. Between 2017 and 2022, Thomas Wood used a different track system requiring adapter pieces, but the line returned to the standard compatible system in 2022.

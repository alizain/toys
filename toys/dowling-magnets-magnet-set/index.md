Dowling Magnets magnet sets are educational science kits produced by a family-owned company based in Elmhurst, Illinois, that has been manufacturing magnetic products since 1946. These kits introduce children to magnetism through hands-on exploration with various types of magnets and accessories. The product line spans from simple introductory sets for preschoolers to advanced kits covering electromagnets and magnetic levitation.

## What It Is

Dowling Magnets produces a range of magnet kits designed for different age groups and skill levels. Entry-level kits like the Very First Magnet Kit and Magnet Mania Kit include oversized, plastic-encased magnets safe for young children, typically containing magnet wands, horseshoe magnets, magnetic marbles, counting chips, ring magnets, and button magnets. These components are designed with chunky handles suitable for small hands.

Intermediate kits like the Super Science Magnet Kit include a greater variety of magnet types: steel horseshoe magnets with neodymium feet, ceramic horseshoe magnets, bar magnets, disc magnets, and plastic-encased bar magnets with visible poles. These kits also include iron filings for visualizing magnetic fields, steel shapes, compasses, and paper clips for experimentation.

Advanced kits target older children and include the Electromagnet Science Kit for building buzzers and motors, the Magic Penny Magnet Kit for constructing gravity-defying coin sculptures, and the Magnet Levitation Kit for building magnetic levitating trains. These kits use stronger magnets and involve more complex assembly.

All kits include multilingual activity booklets with structured experiments. The magnets in early learning kits are completely encased in plastic for safety, while kits for older children may include exposed magnets with appropriate warnings.

## How Kids Play

Young children typically begin by using magnet wands to pick up magnetic marbles and counting chips, discovering which objects attract and which do not. They test magnets on household items, metal surfaces, and through materials like paper, cardboard, and water to observe whether magnetic force passes through different substances.

With horseshoe and ring magnets, children explore attraction and repulsion by pushing magnets together in different orientations. Floating ring magnets on a post demonstrates magnetic repulsion visually. Children sort objects into magnetic and non-magnetic categories and use counting chips for simple math activities.

Older children use iron filings with bar and horseshoe magnets to visualize magnetic field patterns on paper. They build simple compasses using magnetized needles and cork floating in water. With the Super Science Kit, children compare the strength of different magnet types by testing how many paper clips each can hold.

Advanced play involves following step-by-step instructions to build electromagnets, motors, buzzers, and telegraph systems. The Magic Penny Kit challenges children to stack coins in apparently impossible arrangements using magnetic force. The Levitation Kit guides construction of a magnetic train that hovers above a track.

## Notes

The product line is structured progressively, with clear age recommendations: ages 3-4 for basic magnet wands and counting activities, ages 4-8 for the Very First Magnet Kit and Magnet Mania Kit, ages 8-10 for the Super Science and Alnico kits, and ages 10 and up for electromagnet and levitation kits. This tiered approach allows children to advance through increasingly complex magnetic concepts as they grow.

The company emphasizes safety testing, with all products conforming to ASTM F963 and CPSIA toy safety standards. Early learning products specifically avoid small parts and fully encase magnets in plastic. Kits containing stronger magnets or small components carry appropriate choking hazard warnings for children under three.

The inclusion of activity booklets with structured experiments distinguishes these from loose magnet collections. The activities align with Next Generation Science Standards, making them suitable for classroom use as well as home exploration. The booklets are often translated into Spanish, German, and French.
